**Lesson -  Introduction to wireframes**

**Introduction**

In this lesson, we'll discuss wireframes and how it helps other team members visualise what could be placed on a page and what should be avoided. It's also a great tool to use for feedback and to brainstorm ideas. 

## What is a wireframe? 

As you continue the journey to becoming a front-end developer, you will hear the word wireframing quite often. A wireframe is the first step a designer takes to put an idea to paper. It makes sense that wireframes are also called blueprints, and just like a blueprint, a wireframe provides the designer with guidance. 
 
Not only are wireframes there to get the structure and layout of a page in order, but it is an excellent way to organise ideas and test new ones. It also allows designers to see how users can interact with an interface beforehand.

### Purpose of a wireframe 

Wireframes are static representations of the design, and should essentially answer the following questions: 

- How will the structure and layout of the page look? 

- What information will be displayed on the page? 

- How will the interface function? 

Simply put, the wireframing process is essential as it is the foundation of a design and helps map out the information architecture, the user flow and overall structure of a page.

### Wireframes and the design process 

Wireframes are created early in the design process before designers start thinking about an interface's visual elements. This allows designers to make significant changes early on in the process and not later when the design is close to being finalised.  

 ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") 

_Figure 3: Wireframes and the design process_ 

### How does a wireframe look? 

Wireframes should be kept simple and to the point, as the essential purpose is not to communicate the site's visual characteristics but instead the structure and layout of the interface. Wireframes are a simple representation of a design, and as such, normally consist of black, white and grey basic layout designs. For example, a block with a cross can show image placement, and grey lines can represent written text.  

  ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4: Wireframe elements_ 

## Types of wireframes 

There are three different types of wireframes: 

- Low-fidelity. 

- Mid-fidelity. 

- High-fidelity. 

The difference between these three types is mainly based on each type of wireframe's level of detail. 
 
Please click on the tabs below to learn more. 

_**Low-fidelity wireframes**_ 

Low-fidelity wireframes can be seen as the starting blocks of the design process. The designer takes an idea and sketches it out to see if it makes sense and works for the client. Low-fidelity wireframes don't have to be perfect; they only need to communicate the concept. 
 
Another thing that makes low fidelity wireframes so useful is that it creates conversations around the overall layout, the navigation of the interface and outlining the user's flow. 

  ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5: An example of low-fidelity wireframes (Source: uxdesign.cc)_ 

_**Mid-fidelity wireframes**_ 

Mid-fidelity wireframes are a bit more detailed than low-fidelity wireframes but still reasonably simple. Mid-fidelity wireframes should show an exact, detailed representation of the overall layout of the website or app. 
 
Designers can add text weights to highlight headings and paragraph text and boxes that represent images. It also assists in visualising the hierarchy of the elements in the design. Mid-fidelity wireframes are digitally created using tools such as Balsamiq and Adobe XD. 

  ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 6: A mid-fidelity wireframe of the Emov app (Source: medium.com)_ 

_**High-fidelity wireframes**_ 

High-fidelity wireframes should communicate the interface's look and feel. These wireframes are only employed much later in the design process when each page's structure and layout has been decided. At this stage, the user flow and information architecture of the interface have already been determined. 
 
Here placeholder text like Lorem Ipsum is replaced with relevant written content, and instead of a box indicating an image, real images are used. Other visual elements such as colour, typography and the company's branding elements are also added. 

  ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 7: An example of low-fidelity, medium-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes_ 

## Advantages 

There are five advantages of wireframing. Please click on the tabs below to get more insight into these. 

_Clarity_ 

Wireframes bring transparency to interface design. It allows designers to think clearly about the site's interactions and layout needs and assist them in coming up with solutions to problems. 

_Keep the client's attention_ 

Wireframes are an excellent tool to get the client to focus on the site's structure, layout and functionality. Because of its simplicity, the client will not be bothered by other elements such as colour and images. These elements are reserved for later in the design process. 

_Communication to the team_ 

A well-designed wireframe can communicate your creative ideas to the team. It also serves as a useful brainstorming tool between designers and developers, and other stakeholders. 

_Feedback_ 

Wireframes allow for feedback from the client and team members. It also ensures that the primary message of a website is effectively delivered. 

_Responsiveness_ 

A good wireframe can give developers a clear idea of what elements should be coded, how the overall layout needs to adjust from big screens to smaller screens, what content is essential, how developers should implement the overall hierarchy and if navigation on smaller screens is sufficient.

## Lesson Task - Introduction to wireframes 

### Lesson Task 

### Brief 

For this lesson task, you will be designing low fidelity wireframes for a fitness app called 'Fit for Life'. Fit for Life specialises in providing users with exercise routines, tips on cooking healthy meals and connecting them with an online community with similar goals. The target audience is aged between 20 and 40 and is serious about fitness and healthy living. 
 
The different exercise routines can be broken down into the following categories: 

- Building muscle. 

- Fat loss. 

- Triathlon training. 

Users should sign up and buy any exercise routine that fits their fitness goals. Users also get a free diet plan when they join. 

### Level 1 Process 

- Start thinking about the structure of the wireframe. What will fulfil the user's need? Make a list of essential points that should be included. Things like purchase info, bonus info, join now CTA and so forth. 

- Get a paper and pen and start drawing your low fidelity prototype. 

- Don't stick to one wireframe. Explore ideas and think of creative ways to structure your pages. Try to come up with three different approaches. 

- Make sure your wireframe is suitable for both desktop and mobile devices. 

## Lesson - Creating wireframes 

## Lesson Overview 

## Lesson - Creating wireframes 


### Introduction 

This lesson provides an overview of the creation and sharing of wireframes with team members to receive input and provide feedback. We will also look at some online tools to create these wireframes. 

## Importance of wireframes 

As we have learned in the previous lesson, wireframes are an essential step in the design process. Not only to get ideas on paper but also to get feedback from team members. Wireframes specifically look at the layout, structure and functionality of a page and how the layout will change from a big screen to smaller screens. 
 
One other key aspect of wireframes is that when introduced early in the design process, it will iron out minor issues and ensure the basic structure is decided on, making the whole process less taxing and saving money and time in the long run.

## How to create a wireframe 

There are four important steps to follow when creating a wireframe: 

- Research first. 

- Information architecture and user flows. 

- Paper to computer. 

- Choosing the right tools. 

- The steps are discussed below: 

### Research first 

Wireframes may be the first step in the design process, but we first need to spend some time researching before creating a wireframe. We need to understand our target audience. We will perform this step by conducting user research and creating user personas and mood boards. It's also a good idea to see what competitors are doing in the market and the latest trends in the world of UX. 

 ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") 

_Figure 2: An example target audience for an online bookstore_ 

### Information architecture and user flows 

After conducting the user research, you should have a good idea of who your target audience is and the problems you need to solve. It will also give you a clear idea of what should be included on the wireframe, how many pages you will need and the different journeys users will take to meet their goals. Ensure you have a clear plan of the user flows and information architecture of the site. 

 ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") 

_Figure 3: An example of a wireframe user flow for a job-hunting app_ 

### Paper to computer 

It's good to start with a low fidelity wireframe and use plain old pen and paper. When you have figured out what needs to be added and what needs to go, you can move to a medium-fidelity wireframe that will be a digital version of your wireframe. 
 
With your wireframe recreated digitally, you will be able to share it with other team members for some feedback. Of course, you can share your paper wireframe as well, but a digital version will be easier to access, and feedback from colleagues will be more understandable. 
 
An online, digital wireframe also alleviates problems with incorporating the thoughts from the various team members. It may allow for comments from specific team members to be visible to all team members. The image below demonstrates how the process started on paper and was then created digitally using InVision’s Freehand. 

 ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") 

_Figure 4: The job-hunting app from paper to computer_ 

### Choosing the right tools 

There are many online tools out there for creating wireframes, and it is up to the individual to decide which tool works best for their needs. Let's look at three popular wireframe tools. 
 
Please click on the tabs for more information. 

_**Balsamiq**_ 

Balsamiq was started in 2008, and its main goal is to help users create software and websites that are easier to use. Balsamiq Wireframes is a graphical tool to sketch interfaces for websites, desktop and mobile applications. It's vital to take note that Balsamiq offers members a 30-day trial of their web app. After the 30-day trial is over, members need to pay for using the app.

_**InVision Freehand**_ 

InVision Freehand assist designers in getting ideas to paper. Freehand design allows users to explore, evaluate and discuss ideas quickly. Creating wireframes through the Freehand app is effortless as the interface is easy to understand and easy to use.

_Figure 6: InVision’s Freehand app (Source: invisionapp.com/freehand)_ 

_**Adobe XD**_ 

Adobe XD is an excellent prototyping tool but can be used for wireframing as well. You will most probably use Adobe XD for mid-fidelity to high-fidelity wireframes, when team members need to see more details of the overall design and when the wireframe's functionality needs to be tested.

## What is included on a wireframe? 

Now that we have discussed some of the tools available to create wireframes let's look at what needs to be included on a wireframe. We have learned that wireframes consist of basic shapes, and only grey, black and white are used to design these. We have also learned that design elements and their looks are not essential in this process but rather where they will be placed on the page. 

### Page elements 

Wireframes may differ from one website to another, and you may need to add some page elements to solve a specific problem. Nonetheless, here are some essential page elements that are usually included as standard elements on wireframes: 

- Headers - The main headers and subheaders. 

- Navigation - The main navigation and menu items as well as the footer. Breadcrumbs can also be included if needed. 

- Content boxes - For images and body content. 

- Place holder text - For paragraph text and product descriptions. 

- Branding elements - Such as the company's logo. 

- Search fields - If the website requires a search function. 

- Buttons - CTA buttons for users to take action. 

- Contact information - This can be the phone number, social media and a physical address. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") 
 

_Figure 8: An example of wireframe elements used to illustrate a mobile app_ 

Later in the design process, these page elements will become more aesthetically pleasing, but for now, they need to be as straightforward as possible. Remember, we have learned that wireframes aren't to discuss the pages' visual characteristics but rather how the structure and layout will work and where each page element will be placed. 

### Groupings 

When you have decided on the page elements needed for the wireframe, you need to figure out how to group these elements to make sense to a user. For example, you will group your main navigation, menu items, search field and logo and place them at the top of the page. 
 
With the footer, you will group the contact information and social media icons and place them at the bottom of the page. 
 
For the body content, you will be looking at grouping the content boxes and buttons and place them in the middle of the page. 
 
This is just a very basic example, as there are many different ways to group page elements. You will most probably come up with many different versions of one page. 

 ![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") 


_Figure 9: Grouping of wireframe elements_ 

### Feedback from colleagues 

Now that we have made sure the user flow is perfect, the target audience needs are met, and all necessary page elements have been added to the wireframe, we take our design to colleagues for additional feedback. It may become a tiring exercise as people's opinions differ from one another, and your colleagues may not think and see things the same way you do. 
 
Nonetheless, the feedback should be seen as additional information that could make the product and experience pleasant for the user. It's always good to take feedback with an open mind, see it for what it is and not take it too personally. It's about the user, after all. 
 
Using one of the prescribed tools mentioned, you should be able to get the team onboard digitally. 

### From wireframe to prototype 

After the feedback phase, you should have enough information to make some changes to upgrade and improve your design. Your low-fidelity wireframe may be a medium-fidelity wireframe at this stage. With content, copy and functionality, it will soon become a working prototype. 
 
Keep in mind that the wireframe serves as the skeleton of the website. The content and copy is the skin, and the functionality is the muscle. Each part plays a vital role in making the website function correctly.

## Lesson Task - Creating wireframes 

## Lesson Task 

### Brief 

For this lesson task, you will be taking the paper wireframe you have created for 'Fit for Life' in last week's lesson task and turning it into a digital online version using one of the tools discussed in this lesson. Invite fellow students, work colleges and family members to give you feedback on your design. 

### Level 1 Process 

- Start with exploring and finding the tool you find most comfortable to use for wireframing. 

- Take your paper prototype and recreate it digitally. 

- Invite others to look at what you have created and give you feedback on the layout and structure of your wireframe. 

- Make sure your wireframe is suitable for both desktop and mobile devices. 

- Take the feedback given to you and make the changes. It is a good idea to re-test your wireframe after making these changes to see if the structure and layout has a better flow. 

## Lesson - Introduction to prototyping 

## Lesson Overview 

### Lesson - Introduction to prototyping 

## Introduction 

This lesson will look at what prototyping is and why designers must complete this step in the design process. 

## What is a prototype? 

A prototype is a mid to high fidelity design deliverable of the final UI of your website or app. It is also functional and should show how the website would function. 
 
**A prototype is also:** 

- a model or sample of a new product 

- a mockup to test and evaluate how a process or concept would function 

- a way for designers to see if their interface works, get feedback, spot weaknesses, and iron out errors 

- a chance to make amendments and updates as necessary 

- a model or mockup of a UI design, in any stage of the process, to view the functionality, usability, and flow of the product 

- a mockup that gets laid out in a way that represents the real thing 

- a process that should be seen as a time-saving tool. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title") 

_Figure 1: An example of a high-fidelity prototype created in Adobe XD (Source: letsxd.com)_ 

It's vitally important for UI designers to test their designs. This allows them to identify errors and tweak features. Prototyping enables just that - reviewing your designs in action, in an interactive setting. It's a great way to test and explore the system within the team and present the product to a client. With a prototype, you can get feedback, brainstorm ideas, and ensure that the product is heading in the right direction. 
 
We have spoken about the different levels of fidelity with regards to wireframing. There are also different types - or levels - of prototyping fidelity, making testing possible at any part of the process. Design fidelity refers here to the level of detail and functionality within the prototype. 
 
Below we will explore the following levels of fidelity: 

- Low fidelity - paper. 

- Medium fidelity - clickable. 

- High fidelity - advanced. 

### Low fidelity - paper 

This is the most basic prototype level, with minimal detail. It is usually done on paper, with any design features drawn up with a pen. This is the idea testing phase, with simple processes to get feedback on the concept. 
 
The advantage of this type of prototype is that there is no visual aspect to distract from the project outlook. It is a very accessible way to prototype, as everyone can draw! It's also quick to set up. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title") 

_Figure 2: Paper prototyping_ 

### Medium fidelity - clickable 

This process usually consists of wireframe designs with limited visual design. Typically with black and white basic layout designs, this prototype level allows for testing the user-flow, information architecture and basic functionality. 
 
It is a lesser-used level of the prototype but still brings useful feedback to the project. A medium-fidelity prototype should essentially demonstrate the screen layouts and have basic clickability and navigation between screens. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title") 

_Figure 3: An example of a low to medium fidelity prototype (Source: Jad Limcaco)_ 

### High fidelity - advanced 

This is the closest to the final product you can get before actual development. These designs include colour, typography, imagery, navigation, etc. and usually look exactly like the final product is planned to look. 
 
It's a great way to present final designs and concepts for clients, as it looks and behaves like the real deal, but without the time and resources spent on developing the product that will possibly need multiple timely amendments. 
 
This version should be almost fully functional, with as many features, motions, functionality and visual elements as possible. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title") 

_Figure 4: High fidelity prototyping by Jae-seong Jeong (Source: dribbble.com/johnjbrown)_ 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title")

_Figure 5: High fidelity prototyping by Jae-seong Jeong (Source: dribbble.com/johnjbrown)_ 

As we have discussed in the previous lesson, it's advisable to start with a low fidelity wireframe (pen and paper) and then take your design digitally to a medium-fidelity wireframe. After that, the prototyping phase starts, where you will give your design functionality. In this phase, the UI of the website should also be added and finalised. 
 
So, which one should you use? There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each situation should be evaluated and decided individually and according to where you are in the design process. For example, a paper prototype is probably the best option for the earliest version when you are just starting. 
 
When you have done more work on the product's functionality than the UI, medium-fidelity will work well. However, when the process has advanced to where your designs are close to a final phase, a high-fidelity prototype will probably showcase the product best. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title") 

_Figure 6: Low, medium and high-fidelity prototypes_ 

## Basics 

Some principles to keep in mind: 

- always start with the lowest fidelity wireframe 

- don't get attached to your ideas and be open to feedback 

- don't spend too much time on intricate details that will possibly change 

- it doesn't have to be perfect (yet); it just needs to work 

- functionality is key. 

## The testing process 

How does the testing process work? Here are two primary phases you may come across and use in your workflow (please click on the tabs to reveal more information). 

_Internal testing_ 

Run through your designs with your team members or with other designers. It's a great way to bounce ideas, brainstorm solutions and get informal feedback. 

_Stakeholder testing_ 

This phase involves clients and non-designers, allowing you to include the opinions of a broader range of people. It can be uncomfortable, but it's an opportunity for valuable feedback, as most probably see the design from a new perspective. 
 
Remember that feedback is your biggest asset in the design process. It allows for a fresh perspective on the work, a chance for you to look at it in a new light and for improvements to be made. There is a lot to be learnt from testing and feedback processes; be open to listening.

## Lesson Task - Introduction to prototyping 

## Lesson Task 

### Brief 

Create a paper prototype of the home page for a dog walking website. Remember to keep it simple and focus on the interaction rather than the design's finer details. Colours, typography, etc., will come later. 
 
A paper prototype aims to give the user something physical to use and play around with. A paper prototype is different from a wireframe or a mockup because those are 2D, whereas a paper prototype is 3D and much more physically engaging. 
 
Instead of jumping straight into a wireframe design of the site created on your computer, you can try using a paper prototype to test assumptions about how the user interacts with the product. One advantage of paper prototyping is that it's much cheaper to make and build than a coded site that needs to be re-coded. You can move elements around on the page or create new elements in a few moments. 
 
You create the paper prototypes to be simple illustrations of the sorts of elements you would like to include in your interface. They don't need to be smart drawings. A more straightforward design often works best. 
 
When you have a primary paper interface, please take it to users for usability testing and see how they interact with it. Because it looks like it is in such an early stage of development, users will be quick to provide honest feedback, and it helps them generate good 'what if' ideas. What if you put a button here? What if you only had one form on the page? 
 
Paper prototyping focuses users and designers on keeping things simple and on the broader concepts rather than specific details. 

### Level 1 Process 

Draw, cut, paste, and do whatever you'd like to the page. Ensure you keep the design in a physical form so that users can interact with it. 
 
Take the design to a user(s) and get them to interact with it. Listen for feedback, ask them to play around with the design and 'click' items to see what they do. You'll get quick feedback before you've spent time coding anything. Invite suggestions for changes and make them while you're in the session. 

### Level 2 Process 

Add other pages like product lists or the product pages themselves to your paper prototype. 

## **Lesson - Creating prototypes** 

## Lesson Overview 

### Lesson - Creating prototypes 


### Introduction 

In this lesson, we will dive into the process of creating a prototype with Adobe XD/Figma. We will also look at what needs to happen before prototyping can start. 

## Importance of prototyping 

You may wonder why prototyping is so important and why to bother with creating a wireframe and then a full functioning prototype later. These processes all play a vital role in getting things right from the start and delivering the user with a good user experience. 
 
As we have learnt, user testing is critical in the design process. You will test your wireframe and then, later on, do more thorough testing on your prototype where you will invite users to use your interface. 
 
With your wireframe, you will test the structure and layout and determine if these elements make sense to a user. With the prototyping, you will test the functionality of your website or app. Not only will the prototype show functionality, but it should essentially show the visual characteristics of the website as well. 
 
The following questions are examples of things you should ask yourself when using a prototype to test functionality: 

- Did users relate to your choice in colour? 

- Were the fonts used easily readable, and do you have a good visual hierarchy on the site to draw attention to important information? 

- Why did the user miss the primary CTA? Perhaps was it too small, and you should make it a tad bigger. 

- How did users react to specific elements, such as the main navigation? 

- Did they become frustrated on their journey to the end goal? 

- How will your website look and function on different screen sizes?

### Tasks and process 

Proper planning before prototyping is vital. Think about it like this; you won't build a house without adequate planning, right? Surely you need to plan and figure out where the rooms such as the bathroom, main bedroom and living area in the house should be. The same applies when it comes to prototyping. 

### Gather requirements 

Before you can get started on any form of design, it's wise to have a good conversation with the client to gather the project's requirements. What does the client what to achieve in the market, who do they think their target audience is, do they have an existing Corporate Identity (CI) or do you need to design one? What do they want the user to do on their website, and what goals do they want to achieve with the product? 

### Information architecture, wireframes and paper prototypes 

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the client's needs, their main goals for the website and what you need to focus on. You should also have some insights into what kind of business they run and which business model they use. 
 
As a UX designer, it's up to you to bring user and business together by creating a user-friendly product that will generate revenue for the business and pleasure for the users. With the information gathered from your client, start by creating an Information Architecture (IA) for the site after spending a fair amount of time figuring out which pages to include. 
 
Start planning the structure and layout by doing a simple wireframe sketch or create one digitally. After the wireframe process, you will build your paper prototype to conduct user research. 

### User research 

We may have already done user research with the wireframing process to figure out who our target audience is. However, it's still a vital step in the prototyping process to ensure that what you are about to embark on will meet your target audience's needs and pain points. Not only that, but you will quickly learn whether there is a need for your product in the market or not. 
 
Having an aesthetically pleasing website is useless if the users' wants and needs aren't met. The five-step research learning spiral was originated by Erin Sanders at Frog (Erin Sanders, 2014) and is useful in conducting user research. 
 
Let's look at the five steps below to understand the research process better. 

<ol><li>Objectives</li> 

What knowledge do we have about our users at this stage and what knowledge gaps do we need to fill? 

<li>Hypotheses</li> 

The knowledge we already have of our users or we believe we have. What we think we know about their habits and the answers we propose to meet their needs. 

<li>Methods</li> 

How will we fill the gaps in our knowledge of our users and their habits? What strategies will we use and which will work based on the time and workforce we have available? 
 
Will observing our users work better than interviews, or should we maybe do card sorting? If we want to conduct interviews, we need a team of people with experience to ensure the process is a success. It will also be time-consuming, which is challenging if we don't have much time. 

<li>Conduct</li> 

Use the selected methods to gather user data. 

<li>Synthesise</li> 

Now we take the knowledge we have gained from our users and intergrade it into our products to see what possibilities exist for our product's design. </ol> 

## Building a prototype 

We have consulted the client, we have an IA, wireframe and paper prototype created, and we went through user research to see what gaps we need to fill with regards to our product and the user. Next, we will focus on building our prototype and then test it before moving on to coding a fully functional website or app.  

### Prototyping tools 

There are many tools designers can use for prototyping, and ultimately it's up to you to find one that meets your needs. We will be focusing on Adobe XD and Figma for this course, but another popular contenders in the market is Sketch. 

Sketch is a vector-based graphics editor and is primarily used for user interface and user experience design. One downfall is that it is only available to MAC users. They offer users a 30-day free trial, but you would need to pay to use the app after that. 
 
To learn more about Sketch, visit their website here: https://www.sketch.com/.

### Adobe XD 

Adobe XD is an application to design and share user interfaces for apps, websites, etc. Adobe XD is free but also offers a paid version. The difference between the free and paid version is that there is a limitation to the number of active prototypes a designer can share with the free version. The free starter pack offers only one active shared prototype, whereas the paid version has an unlimited amount. 

### Starting with Adobe XD 

You should already have some familiarity with Adobe XD from earlier lessons in the design course, but here we'll go into further detail. 

<ol><li>Download</li> 

If you have not yet downloaded XD, please go to https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html. You don't need to buy a subscription to download XD. There is a free version available. Download and install the application as per the prompts.

_Figure 4: Adobe XD download_ 

<li>Create a new document</li> 

Open up XD, create a new document, choose a device to design for: mobile, tablet or desktop. There are drop-down options where you can select a specific device model/format (like iPhone X/Android Tablet/Web 1280), or select a custom size. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title") 

_Figure 5: Adobe XD create-a-new-document screen_ 

<li>Design mode</li> 

XD has three different modes to help keep your project organised: Design, Prototype and Share. 
 
You can find these options in the top-left corner of the header bar. 
 
When you have created a new document, you will land in Design Mode. Here you can create your interface designs across multiple screens, which are called artboards. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title") 

_Figure 6: Adobe XD design mode_ 

<li>Prototype mode</li> 

When your design is ready to start building your prototype, head over to Prototype mode. Here you can link up screens and apply everything you need to have a functional prototype. You can learn about this more in-depth in the lesson activities. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg  "a title")

_Figure 7: Adobe XD prototype mode_ 

<li>Share</li> 

When you are done building your prototype, ready to test the functionality and have other people view it, select the Share tab. Here you can title your preview, choose a view setting, and set the privacy permissions. When you have generated a URL, this can be shared with anyone and will open in their browser. They don't need to have XD installed to view it. When you make changes to your project after this sharing link has been generated, the link needs to be updated to reflect the latest design version.
