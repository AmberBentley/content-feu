### Introduction

Every second we see thousands of colours. Colours are everywhere and even though, according to experts, we can distinguish close to 10 million different colours, we can only name a small part of all colours we can see. In this lesson, we will look at the fundamentals of colour. We will look at how the colour wheel works and how the user experiences colour.

### Colour in design
Colour is one of the most difficult subjects in design. The difficulty is that colour is highly subjective – the combinations, harmonies, or discordance (clashes) that develop are subject to the viewers’ personal experiences and preferences. Colour tastes and meanings also vary across cultures and countries. Therefore, one single formula for effective colour-use does not exist – each new project that a designer encounters deals with decisions on colour for that project, task, and target audience. 
 
Although the choice of colours is perhaps subjective and based on our personal experiences, it is important to understand the basic principles of colour theory and how colour works. 
 
For our purposes, we will focus on colour theory as an aid to create aesthetic designs and to express a message visually. As designers, we study colour for two main reasons: To communicate the chosen colours to other designers using the colour system and to gain knowledge in how to apply colour. 
 
Communicating about colour becomes important in design, as the mere words “blue”, “green”, “red” and others are not sufficient. When speaking of “blue”, do we mean blue as the ocean or blue as the sky? It becomes even more explicit when dealing with printed material and front-end development. 
 
Every corporate identity has its own colour combination, and this must be applied uniformly across all elements, consistently. To achieve this, we need to be able to code and standardize colours. Pantone is an example of such a colour-code; printers and designers use it to determine which exact colour to use. Pantone also provides a standard to measure colours from. In web development, colours may be specified as an RGB (sRGB) triplet or in hexadecimal (HEX) code. Later in these lessons, we will learn and explore more about how the hexadecimal colour model works.

### The basic principles of colour theory 
Colour is the perceptual characteristic of light described by a colour name. Specifically, colour is light, and light is composed of many colours - those we see are the colours of the visual spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Objects absorb certain wavelengths and reflect others back to the viewer. We perceive these wavelengths as colour. 
 
In the visual arts, colour theory forms a practical guide to colour mixing. In addition to this, it focuses on the impacts of specific colour combinations. There are also definitions (or categories) of colours based on the colour wheel: Primary colours, Secondary colours and Tertiary colours. 
### Describing colour 
Unfortunately, many different colour-coding systems use different terminology when describing colour, and others go into more detail; defining individual characteristics. For our purposes, we will stick to the very basics and work from there. Thus, you may encounter different terms in other references, but they all aim to differentiate the same fundamental thing.

A colour is described in three ways: 

- - By its name (hue)  

- - How pure or unsaturated it is (saturation) 

- - Its value or brightness (intensity) 
  
![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2. An example of hue, saturation and brightness._

Although pink, crimson, and brick are all variations of the colour red, each hue is distinct and differentiated by its hue, saturation and brightness. 

### Hue, saturation, and brightness 

Hue, saturation, and brightness (HSB, sometimes called HSV) are aspects of colour in the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) scheme. All possible colours can be specified according to hue, saturation, and brightness, just as colours can be represented in terms of the R, G, and B components. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 3. The HSB colour cylinder (Wikimedia, 2015)_ 

_Hue_

The pure colours are called hues, but there are, of course, many more colours visible to the human eye. We do not have a name for every exact colour in our daily language - it would be impossible to give exact names to a million different colours. Therefore, we speak of pure hues, and then mixes of these (which can be hues in their own right) and then we break it down deeper into further hues. 
 
For example, blue is a pure hue (we give it the name “blue”). Now we add a little bit of white and red to it and it is still seen as blue, but not exactly the same – it is a colour in its own right. We call it lilac-blue. Now we add a little more red to it and, since this exact colour doesn’t have a distinct name, we refer to it as a hue of blue; or a hue of the hue blue, if you like. 

_Saturation (a.k.a. chroma)_

The degree of purity of a hue. Saturation is defined as the "colourfulness of an area judged in proportion to its brightness". It controls the intensity of a colour, from vivid at 100% to grey or white at 0%. 

Value (a.k.a. brightness, lightness/ luminance) 

A measure of the amount of light reflected from a hue. Hues with a high content of white have a higher luminance or value. Goes from bright colour or white at 100% to black at 0%.

_Figure 4. The CMYK, RGB and HSB Lab colour models in Illustrator CC 2020. They appear in the same way in Photoshop and other graphic programs._ 

### Colour Systems

- - Available colour systems are dependent on the medium with which a designer is working. When painting, an artist has a variety of paints to choose from. 

- - Mixed colours are achieved through the subtractive colour method.  

- - When a designer or front-end developer generates digital products and solutions on the computer, colours are achieved through the additive (RGB) colour method. 

- - When we mix colours for the printing process, we use the subtractive (CMYK) colour system.

  _Subtractive colour and the CMYK system_

  When we mix colours using paint, or through the printing process, we are using the subtractive colour method. Subtractive colour mixing means that one begins with white and ends with black. As colour is added, the result grows darker and tends toward black. It also means that colour is created by the effect of light reflecting from a surface. In design, we often speak of the CMYK system: 

C = Cyan (a distinct blue)

M = Magenta (a distinct hue of red) 

Y = Yellow

K = Black / key

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5. Subtractive (CMYK) colour method._ 

Theoretically, we should get black when we mix all these colours. However, in reality we get a murky dark colour. Black is mixed as a colour of its own – separate from the others. The K stands for “key”, as this is the key, or main plate, others align to in printing. 

Additive colour and the RGB system 

When we work on a computer, the colours we see on the screen are created with light using the additive colour method. Additive colour mixing begins with black and ends with white – as more colour is added, the result gets lighter, and tends toward white. It also means that colour is created by the effect of light moving directly into the eye. 
 
The R = Red, G = Green and B = Blue colours are light primaries and colours are created with light. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 6. Addictive (RGB) colour method._


  _Working with the colour systems_
  There is a difference between additive colour and subtractive colour: 

  - - The colour produced in the additive system appears brighter. 

  - - The visible range in the additive system is wider – thus, more colours can be created in the additive than in the subtractive system. 

  The visible spectrum consists of billions of colours. A monitor can display millions of colours, but a high-quality printer is only capable of producing thousands. Older computer systems may be limited to 216 cross-platform colours. 

  _Colour gamut - RGB colours to CMYK colours_  
  
Colour gamut is the entire range of colours and tones achievable by an imaging system. 
 
Reproducing colour can be problematic in terms of printed and digital media; what we see on a monitor cannot be printed. Although a monitor may be able to display “true colour” (16,000,000 colours), millions of these colours are outside of the spectrum available to printers. Since digital designs are generated using the RGB colour system, colours used in those designs must be part of the CMYK spectrum or they will not be reproduced with proper colour rendering. Working within the CMYK colour system, or choosing colours from Pantone© palettes, ensures proper colour rendering.

## The colour wheel 

A colour wheel (also referred to as a colour circle) is a visual representation of colours, arranged according to their colour relationship. Begin a colour wheel by positioning primary hues (the main colours from which others are created – red, yellow and blue) at equal distances from one another, and then create a bridge between primaries using secondary and tertiary colours. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 8. The colour wheel._ 

_Primary Colours_

As the name suggests, primary colours are the main colours at the top. These can be seen as the parents of all the other colour combinations. They are the foundation of every other colour and can create millions of colours by mixing the three primary pigments which are yellow, red, and blue. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 9. Primary colours._ 

_Secondary Colour_

They can be seen as the children of the primary colours and consist of green, orange and purple. In colour theory when we mix yellow and red it becomes orange. Red and blue becomes purple and blue and yellow becomes green. The end result of mixing the primary colours are then called secondary colours. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 10. Secondary colours._ 

_Tertiary Colours_

Tertiary colours are the colours in between the primary and secondary colours and can be seen as the grandchildren of the three primary colours. They consist of yellow/orange, red/orange, red/purple, blue/purple, blue/green and yellow/green. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 11. Tertiary colours._

_Complementary Colour_

These are located opposite one another on a colour wheel. To call those hues that are directly opposite one another “complements of each other” is correct. Complementary colours bring out the best in each other. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 12. Complementary colours._ 

When fully saturated complements are brought together, interesting effects are noticeable. This may be a desirable illusion, or a problem if you are creating visuals that needs to be read.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 13. A problem occurs when reading the red text on the green background._ 

_Analogous colours_

Analogous colours are colours located close together on a colour wheel. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 14. Analogous colours._ 

_Colour Ranges_

A colour wheel can be divided into ranges that are visually active or passive. Active colours will seem to advance (pop) when placed against passive hues. Passive colours seem to recede (fade) when positioned against active hues. This becomes important when dealing with the interaction of colours. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 15. Passive and active colours._ 

- Advancing hues are often thought to have less visual weight than receding hues. 

- Warm, saturated, light value hues are "active" and seem to visually advance. 

- Cool, low saturated, dark value hues are "passive" and seem to visually recede. 

- Tints or hues with a low saturation appear lighter than shades or highly saturated colours. 

- Some colours remain visually neutral or indifferent. 

_Colour Combination_

Colour combinations may pass unnoticed when they are pleasing to the eye – yet they offend dramatically when the compositions clash. One outcome we seek in the final form or composition of a design is a successful use of colour. 
 
We determine whether or not our colour usage is successful by critically assessing the visual balance and harmony of the final composition. Balance and harmony are achieved by the visual contrast that exists between colour combinations. When planning a successful colour combination, we need to first investigate and understand colour relationships. 
 
Using a colour wheel and a template, the relationships between colours are easy to identify: 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 16. Complementary colours._ 

# Colour and Contrast 

Every visual presentation involves figure-ground relationships. This relationship between a subject (or figure) and its surrounding field (ground) will display a level of contrast; the more an object contrasts with its surroundings, the more visible it becomes. 
 
When creating designs that are intended to be read, it is important to offer the viewer enough contrast between the background (paper or screen) and the text. Text presentations ideally offer at least an 80% contrast between figure and ground. (Black text on a white background is ideal.) If there is not enough contrast between figure and ground, the viewer will squint to view the text – causing their eyes to get tired. 
 
Yellow text on a white background or blue text on a black background is difficult to read due to the low level of contrast between figure and ground. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 17. Difficult to read text due to the low level of contrast between figure and ground._ 

An occurrence known as “simultaneous contrast” (or chromo stereopsis) may happen when opposing colours are placed in close proximity to each other. Text may appear to vibrate or may seem to cast a shadow. Eyestrain and fatigue will result if a viewer focuses on a document displaying similar properties for a long period of time. 
 
Some colour combinations, such as red text on a blue background, cause illusions when positioned together. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

# Colours, associations and emotions 

It is good to have some knowledge in understanding the different emotional attributes the main colour groups can bring to a design. The main colours are: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, White and Black. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 19. Color psychology guide (Decary, 2019)_ 

_Red_

Red is a rich, exciting, dramatic colour. It also has the feeling of affection and passion, as it is, for example, often used for Valentine’s Day.  

Red is also often used in food, wine and beverage websites due to its indulgent feeling.  

Red is a warm, brighter colour and can make a user more alert since it attracts attention and creates energy.  

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 20. An example of red used on a lifestyle blog (Markiewicz, 2018)_ 

_Orange_

Orange has a feeling of energy, enthusiasm, creativity.  

Orange is a stand-out colour in real life, often used for high visibility objects such as life jackets and road cones.  

Orange is also a warm and versatile colour. It can be energizing, but a lighter orange can be unobtrusive.  

Orange can stimulate metabolism and appetite as well. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 21. A good example of orange being used on wix.com (wix.com, 2020)_

_Yellow_

Yellow is associated with happiness.  

Yellow is a visible colour used to highlight. For example, it is used for taxi cabs and caution signs.  

Yellow is also an energetic colour without the extreme of red.  

However, too much yellow can be overpowering. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 22. A good example of yellow being used on website (pittoridicinema, 2020)_ 

_Green_

- Green has a feeling of growth and freshness.  

- It is a colour often used with nature and environmental websites.  

- Green is in between a warm and cool colour, although leaning more towards the cools.  

- Green is easier on the eyes, compared to red and yellow, creating a relaxing, soothing feel.  

- Green can also represent stability.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 23. Green on a website creating a feeling of growth and freshness (fiverr.com, 2020)_

_Blue_

- Blue is associated with calmness and has a relaxing and safe feel.  

- Two popular social media sites use this colour - Twitter and Facebook.  

- Blue is not often found in foods - it reduces appetite.  

- Blue also promotes Intelligence, reliability, and stability.  

- Blue is found in the sea and the sky and gives a sense of ease, so it is a colour often found in airline and cruise websites. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 24. Blue promotes reliability and stability (evolvewealth.co.uk, 2019)_

_Purple_

- Purple is associated with luxury and power.  

- This colour is also linked with mystery and magic.  

- Purple is historically linked to royalty, for example as used in coat of arms in stamps. 

- Purple is not often used in websites. But if used correctly, it can create a lavish and indulgent feel. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 25. Purple to create a lavish and indulgent feel (cadbury.co.za, 2020)_

_White_

- White has an association of light, cleanliness, and simplicity.  

- White is mostly linked to innocence and purity in the western cultures; for example, white used for wedding dresses. In the Eastern culture, the colour is associated with mourning.  

- White is often used as a background in minimalistic websites. It is great to use when you want to draw attention to other elements/colours on the page. For example, in art websites when you want the user to focus on artwork. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 26. White is often used in minimalistic websites (Wieland, 2020)_

_Black_

- Black can be associated with elegance and power.  

- Black is the strongest of the neutral colours and is used in many websites, often as the text colour, although it can be used as the main strong colour of the site.  

- Black is also linked to evil and edginess.  

- It is also often used to give a feeling of sophistication.

## Lesson - Understanding the colours of the web 

### Lesson Overview 
### Lesson - Understanding the colours of the web 

### Introduction
Understanding the colours of the web and knowing how they work is fundamental for any web developer. In the previous lesson, we’ve touched on the RGB colour system and looked at the differences between CMYK and RGB values; specifically, which is used for print and which is used for the web. In this lesson, we will further discuss the colours of the web. We will also have a look at Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and how colour should be applied to meet these guidelines.

## Hex and RGB colour codes

Hexadecimal colour codes are used in web design for the colours in a website and are often referred to as hex. Hex can be used in your CSS styling and are supported in all browsers. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 1. An example of HEX and RGB colour codes in Adobe Photoshop._ 

RGB (red-green-blue) is also used on the web to represent colours, but they are written in different ways in the code. 

## RGB Colours
RGB define all colours as a combination of three different values for Red, Green and Blue: 

- - RGB (0, 0, 0) - this is black 
![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2. RGB 000 – black._ 

- - RGB (255, 255, 255) - this is white 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 3. RGB 255, 255, 255 – white._ 

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the colour as an integer between 0 and 255. Play around with different RGB values to create a colour here. 

### Hexadecimal 
Hexadecimal uses 16 unique digits (0-F). Decimal only consists of the numbers 0 to 9, so in order to have 16 unique numbers or digits, the letters A to F are used for the extra 6 digits in hexadecimal: 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4. Hex digits._ 

A hexadecimal colour code is a 6-digit colour code prefixed with #. They look like this: 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5. #CC3300._ 

To understand the letters and numbers used after the #, a hexadecimal colour is specified as: 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 6. #RRGGBB a hexadecimal colour._ 

In the #RRGGBB above: the first two digits denote red, the second two digits is for green, while the last two digits represent the blue shade. The hex colour system converts each value to hexadecimal. In reality, it’s still representing the same RGB value, just in another form. You may have heard it mentioned that RGB is a 24-bit colour. Since each of the three colours needs to have an equal portion of the 24-bits, it means that each of the three colours is represented by 8 bits. Otherwise known as a byte. This explains why the value range for each of the colours in RGB is 0 to 255 since 0 is the lowest value you can store in a byte and 255 is the highest. 
 
How does this relate to hexadecimal? Every hexadecimal digit is represented by four bits, which means that every byte of an RGB value can be represented by two hexadecimal digits, for instance: 

255 is 11111111 when written as a byte (a binary bit string) 

If that byte is divided into two separate bit strings, it becomes 1111 and 1111 

When the bit string 1111 is converted to hexadecimal, it becomes the digit F. 

So that means, when written next to another, the bit strings 1111 and 1111 becomes FF. 

This makes a decimal value of 255 equal to a hexadecimal value of FF. 

So an RGB value of 255, 255, 255 would get converted to FF, FF, FF which is written in hexadecimal colour notation as #FFFFFF. 

With this logic, you’ll define how much red, green, and blue are in a colour by defining hexadecimal values between 00 and FF for each of the 3 parameters, instead of values in the decimal range of 0 to 255 like in RGB. 
 
For the hex symbols going from 00 to Ff, 00 is dark/min colour/or black, and FF is bright/max colour/or white. 
 
For example: 
#0000FF - is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF), and the others are set to 00.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 7. #0000FF displayed as blue._ 

Each number denotes the intensity of that particular colour, some other examples: 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 8. #FF0000 only red (no green, no blue)_ 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 9. #00FF00 -- only green (no red, no blue)_ 

#FFFFFF -- if all colours are in equal intensity, you get white. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 10. #FFFFFF all white text._

Abbreviated hex codes 
Hex codes like #FFF, #000, #0F0 or even #ABC are hex codes that use three digits. This is the shorter way of writing a code which is three pairs of identical digits: #FFFFFF, #000000, #00FF00 or #AABBCC. 

### Which one should you choose when coding? 

Many developers find hex values easier to read, so they use hex. Most design programs also provide the colour values in hex. At times, RGB is also used in CSS, as you can add an alpha value which is helpful when wanting to change the opacity of the colour. Bear in mind that when an alpha value is added to RGB, it becomes ARGB, which is a 32-bit colour and no longer a 24-bit colour. An extra byte of information is added to define the opacity/transparency of the colour. 
 
See the infographic below for a better understanding of the use of the different colour system and when to use each one.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 

Most restaurants, universities, shopping malls, and other public spaces cater for people with disabilities. Specifically individuals that cannot walk and are bound to a wheelchair. Have you ever noticed the wheelchair sign or the ramp outside a shopping mall that gives access to these individuals? Just as the architects and builders took them into consideration by providing them specialised access, so too does a front end developer need to do when designing and developing a website.  

### What is WCAG
As mentioned earlier, WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and was put into practice to make web content more user friendly for those with disabilities. Disabilities include, among others, colour blindness, low vision, or no vision at all, individuals with hearing problems, and individuals that are sensitive to flashing lights. 
 
People with disabilities are trying to accomplish the same things daily as people without a disability. They just need specialised tools to achieve their goals. Think of individuals with a colour-blind disability. Will they be able to distinguish between the call to action (CTA) button if it was green and the background if it was red? Probably not, they would have a hard time figuring out where the CTA is to add that pair of shoes to the cart. Will the flashing animation cause a problem with hypersensitive individuals? What about those individuals that suffer from low vision? Will they be able to see the physical address hosted in the footer if the text is small? These are all things that you as a front-end developer need to take into consideration. Your website needs to cater to these people just like it would for individuals without disabilities. 
 
For this lesson, we will take a closer look at the different types of colour blindness and what tools you as a developer can use to design a website with these individuals in mind. 

## Colour Blindness
Colour blindness affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. The most common colour blindness is known as the ‘red/green colour blindness . Individuals that suffer from red-green colour blindness struggle to tell the difference between red and green. 
 
According to the National Eye Institute the different types of colour blindness are red-green colour blindness, blue-yellow colour blindness and complete colour blindness (National Eye Institute, 2019). 

Red-green colour blindness 

Deuteranomaly. The most common type of red-green colour blindness. It makes green look more red. This type is mild and doesn’t usually get in the way of normal activities.  
 
Protanomaly. Makes red look more green and less bright. This type is also mild and usually does not get in the way of normal activities.  
 
Protanopia and Deuteranopia. Both of these make individuals unable to tell the difference between red and green.

_Figure 14. The difference between normal vision and Protanopia._ 

_Blue-yellow colour blindness_

The National Eye Institute (2019) further explains that the blue-yellow colour blindness is the less-common type of colour blindness. For individuals suffering from this type of disability it’s hard to tell the difference between blue and green and between yellow and red. 
 
Tritanomaly makes it hard to tell the difference between blue and green, and between yellow and red.  
 
Tritanopia makes it hard to tell the difference between blue and green, purple and red, and yellow and pink. It also makes colours look less bright. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 15. The difference between normal vision and Tritanopia._ 

_Complete colour blindness_

Monochromacy is when someone is completely colour blind, they can’t see colour at all. This deficiency is quite rare.  

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 16. The difference between normal vision and someone who is completely colour blind._ 

### Tools to ensure good colour 

To ensure there is a good contrast between colour you can use the following online tools: 

_Color Oracle_

Color Oracle is a free colour blindness simulator for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It takes the guesswork out of designing for colour blindness by showing you in real time what people with common colour vision impairments will see. Download the app and install it on your device. Then check you work to see if there is a clear differentiation between colours.  

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 17. colororracle.org._ 

_Toptal_

With toptal.com you enter the website URL that needs to be colour checked. The website will then provide you with filters from which you can choose from. These include common colour impairments. After the website has generated the result it will be displayed in the preferred colour filter. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 18. Topal.com colorblind web page filter._ 

It’s vital that your website that caters for everybody’s needs. For instance, individuals with a colour blind deficiency are not able to tell red and green apart, but they need to be able to see the difference between the colours on your website.  Use tools such as these to check whether it is possible to differentiate the various colours used on the website, before deploying to the public.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

### Introduction

Typography is the process of arranging letters, words, and text for almost any context you can imagine. It’s simple. If you get it right your target audience will understand your message instantly. If you get wrong, they will be left confused and unimpressed. In this lesson, we look at the basics of typography, what the difference between a font and typeface is, and the small details that will create a lasting impression with your target audience. 

|     | NOTE<br><br>This lesson contains 4 activities that you should complete. |

## What does typography mean? 

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make language visible. 
 
The arrangement of type involves the selection of typefaces, point size, line length, leading (line spacing), adjusting the spaces between groups of letters (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 1. A good explanation on typography by Herman Zapf (Morgan Cole, 2019)_

Typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic designers, art directors, comic book artists, graffiti artists, clerical workers, and anyone else who arranges type for a product perform typography. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. The use of computers has opened typography to new generations of visual designers and lay users. It has been said that "typography is now something everybody does". 

## Typography and semantics 

The word "semantics" refers to the meaning behind a word. In other words, the concept or idea it is expressing. Apart from the arrangement of letters to express the idea, designers often enhance that by changing the shape or colour or placement of the word (all the letters together) to further emphasise the idea. 

### Understanding type 

Many people define typography as the art or practice of arranging letters and words. This description is perhaps too broad and simplistic for us to make any real sense of what typography is about. What kinds of letters and words are we talking about? And how are they created? 
 
Let’s look at it in more detail: 

- - Typography is about how letters and words are arranged, 

- - How these letters and words are composed in relation to each other, and 

- - How they are placed within an artwork. 

Typography comes into play when we: 

- - Choose fonts 

- - Decide on the spacing of letters, words, and lines 

- - Choose the size of letters and the length of lines 

- - Ensure that the copy is easy to read on different media and screen sizes.

### Seeing typography

In our daily lives, we are surrounded by so much typographic matter and designs that we don’t even notice it anymore. Go and grab a magazine, chocolate wrapper, or your mobile phone. Look at all the different types of these different elements. Can you see that a lot of time, energy, and detail went into each design? Did you ever think about the fact that a chocolate wrapper not only has to showcase the branding of the product, but it also must communicate nutritional value? It’s not news to us that the text in the books, magazines, or websites we read and use on a daily basis is easy to follow. It is easy to follow not just because of its informative and entertaining content, but also because it was designed typographically, allowing us to read with ease. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2. Lindt chocolate wrapper front and back (Ally’s Basket, 2020)_ 

## Typography in daily life 

Imagine removing all the typography from the main local road. How would we find our way around if we couldn’t read the names of streets or shops? If there were no labels on products, how would we know how much of a medication to take? Or for how long the cake should be in the oven? Without typography, life would be inconvenient and confusing. 
 
Although typography can be found in almost every aspect of our lives, identifying what it is can be quite difficult. It’s almost like listening to music. You may know that you are listening to Poker Face by Lady Gaga, but do you know what style of music it is? Which instruments are being played? What timing is the music set to and in which key it is played? Recognising typography is similar in many ways. Awareness of what we are looking at in the case of typography is part of the key to understanding the subject. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 3. Bad typography is everywhere. Good typography is invisible (Craig Ward, 2016)._

### The nature of typography 

Here’s an interesting question: are all kinds of writing and letters seen as typography? The answer is definitely no! To find out why we have to take a look at history. Johannes Gutenberg from Germany invented a moveable metal type during the mid-fifteenth century. Printing from moveable metal types meant that once a text had been printed, the characters could be rearranged to form new texts. This innovation, along with the technology of the mechanical press, allowed for the production of multiple copies of texts in a much easier, faster, and cheaper way than producing handwritten manuscripts (which was the case before Gutenberg’s invention). 
 
The technology of duplicating letters plays an important role in the definition of typography. Although modern technologies have changed dramatically since Gutenberg’s time, the basic nature of typography has changed very little. 

## Typography and semantics (continued) 
### What typography is 

After reading the section above, we can add the following to our definition of typography: typography allows for the arrangement of letters and words (along with other visual material) to be reassembled and replicated as few or as many times as needed to communicate a message. 
 
Typography is of course also bound by the medium or technology through which it is distributed. For example, the typography on a poster will be approached differently from the typography of a news website. When words are viewed on small screens, like that of smartphones, people should still be able to read it with ease. 
 
Keep in mind that typography isn’t just a creative art or craft, it is a very technical subject that demands certain standards. To achieve this, typographers tap into practices and methods that were established over hundreds of years. 
 
Typography uses signs (letters) to represent spoken and written language. There are, however, elements of language that typography doesn’t have any signs for (like tone of voice). There are also other “typographic” signs that have no utterance in language. Letters are signs that represent sound, but as signs alone, they have no meaning, just as the individual sounds (phonemes) have no meaning. Only when arranged together do they form words; and words are in turn signs (or labels) used to describe our environment, experiences, and concepts. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4. Letters alone are meaningless. Words with meaning._

Typography can be looked at on different levels. There is the holistic view. This involves looking at the page, layout, composition, number of columns, and interaction of text and images. And then there is the detailed view: the choice of typeface, sizes, letter-spacing, word-spacing, line length, line-spacing, use of ligatures, small caps, drop caps, and so on. 

|     | TIP<br><br>When working with typography and layout, always take a step back and look at the "big picture" (holistic view/macro view). |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |

These two levels are sometimes referred to as “macro” and “micro” typography. One is often neglected in favour of the other. Some designers see the macro view as “creative” typography or graphic design. However, spending time understanding the finer details of typography (the micro view) can only benefit the designer and the design. 
 
Remember, the main purpose of typography is to convey information and to make reading easy, not to hinder it. It is also important for typography to act appropriately. So, when you work with typography, keep the content and the context of the text in mind. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5. An example of how the type of font can change the context of the message._

### Making appropriate choices 

If asked to design and develop a website for a conference on the future of medical equipment, we wouldn’t expect to see out-dated fonts being used. At the same time, we wouldn’t expect to see something so ultra-modern that it looks like it's from outer space. 
 
Keep the expectations of your target audience in mind, since that will play a role in your use of typography. That doesn’t mean that typography should be boring. Typographically speaking, however, your design shouldn’t turn up to the party in a Malibu Barbie costume when the invitation is for black-tie only! 
 
Beatrice Warde said that good typography should be like drinking wine from a crystal glass. We should be allowed to concentrate on the wine and not be distracted by the container that carries it. 
 
This is also true when we are reading a novel. We want to get into the narrative, get to know the characters and the plot. We’re not necessarily interested or even aware of the type and typography that carries this information. 
 
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule. For example, if we are at a busy train station, we do want to be aware of the typography around us, because we need to figure out how to get from point A to point B, or just buy a ticket. Firstly, we should notice the typography and secondly, it should be easy to read. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 6. Example of trilingual sign (John van Weelden, 2018)._

Did you know that people read before they read? That may sound odd, but we do this all the time without even noticing it. The layout, composition, use of colour, choice of typefaces, size of type, the width of columns, and other aspects within a design all combine to send out signals that we “read” as a whole before getting down to the job of actually reading the text. If the first “read” doesn’t draw viewers in, they won’t bother to do the second read. That is why both macro and micro typography deserves attention.

Take a quick look at these two websites:

_Figure 8. This website is trustful and the information easy to comprehend._

At a glance you can easily make a decision on which of the websites is more trustful and inviting to actually read the article. 

### What typography is not 

To understand what typography is, it is also important to determine what typography is not. To do this, we need to clearly distinguish typography from other closely related subjects, crafts, and activities. 
 
Students beginning to study typography often have difficulty recognising the difference between lettering and typography, particularly when that lettering is used within a graphic design context. This could be a highly stylised product name on a piece of packaging supported by typographic matter. In fact, it’s not such an easy job for even experienced graphic designers to make such distinctions sometimes!

Let’s take a look at what typography is not: 

- - Typography isn’t… handwriting 

- - Typography isn’t… lettering 

- - Typography isn’t… carving letters into stone or wood by hand 

- - Typography isn’t… sign-writing 

- - Typography isn’t… graffiti 

- - Typography isn’t… building letters out of matchsticks 

In short, typography does not involve producing letters uniquely and one-by-one by hand (or tool). 
 
This does not mean that the above ways of creating letters cannot lead to typography. A typographer may be inspired by handwriting, matchsticks, or graffiti and create a typeface that looks similar to that. There are even fonts that allow letters to appear different each time. For example, Johannes Gutenberg’s original Textura type contained alternative versions of letters that helped the type appear closer to the handwriting look that he tried to create.

Remember when you first started school and learnt about the ABCs and how to write? It’s quite a lengthy and intense process. Learning typography is very similar - it doesn’t happen overnight! Focus on getting the basics right at first; then take your time to experiment with different techniques. 

## Typographic basics

We will take a look at some basic and universal terms and concepts that you need to master when working with typography. 

Typeface or font 

Designers are often unsure of the difference between the terms “typeface” and “font”, as they are both well-used terms for pretty much the same thing. 
 
The Thesaurus dictionary defines it as follows: 

- - Font = a set of type of one particular face and size. 

- - Typeface = a particular design of type. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 10. An example of typefaces and fonts._

In other words, a typeface is a family of fonts (such as Arial Regular, Arial Italic, Arial Bold, Arial Black and Arial Narrow). A font is one weight or style within a typeface family (such as Arial Regular). 
 
The FontShop's description of the difference between a typeface and font is excellent. They describe it as: A typeface is what you see – a font is what you use to make it happen. 

_Typeface classifications_ 

There are many different classifications of typefaces, but the two most common types you will hear of are serif and sans serif. Serif typefaces are the more traditional ones. They are distinguished by a short line or finishing stroke on the end of character strokes and stems (see the picture below). Sans serif typefaces are distinguished by their lack of any serifs. They only became popular in the nineteenth century and as a result, they are considered modern. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 11. An example of serif and sans serif font._

As you can see, there are a few different classes of typefaces and it's worth learning classifications to get a better overview. Through the years there have been different types of classifications, but here is the classification system that is most popular and used today. 

_Anatomy_ 

Below are some of the basic parts of the anatomy of typographic characters. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 12. Anatomy of typography (Nikita Prokhorov, 2019)._

_Kerning and Tracking_ 

Kerning is the adjustment of the spacing between individual characters. 
Tracking, however, is the spacing of a group of characters. 
 
These two are often confused. Use this simple way to remember the difference between the two: “tracking” sounds like the lines of railway tracks which consist of individual tracks grouped together into one long track line, whereas “kerning” sounds like the kernel of a seed, which is one (individual) object. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 13. Kerning and Tracking._

_Alignment_ 

- - Generally, text should be left-aligned, simply because we are used to reading from left to right. 

- - Only centre or right-align text if it is a small number, such as a heading or caption. 

- - Justifying text (where it has a straight edge on both sides) should be used in moderation too. It looks nice and neat in some situations, but too much of it will make a layout look rigid. 

- - If you justify text in a small column size, it can cause irregular spacing between words as the software attempts to adjust your text to fit. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 14. Left aligned and justified text._

_Measure_ 

This refers to the length of lines of text in a paragraph or column. Most people tend to just refer to it as column width though. Measure is an important thing to get right in typography because it can be crucial to the readability of the text. If the measure is too wide the text may be difficult to read since the eye has to move a lot more after each line is read. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 15. Column measure._

_Leading_ 

Vertical line spacing is referred to as leading in typography. In the old days of printing and setting blocks of type, strips of lead were inserted between the lines based on how much space was needed. Leading’s role in typography is to ensure that there is enough space between the lines to make it readable. As with all matters of typography, it is a balance between reading comfort and aesthetic style. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 16. Leading spacing._

_Ligatures_ 

When parts of the anatomy of characters either clash, or appear too closely together, they can be combined in ligatures. These can be for functional or decorative reasons depending on how obvious the clash is. Mostly, this is only an issue with serif fonts, although sometimes sans serifs will need ligatures to be set too. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 17. Ligatures._

_Hyphenation_ 

Neither designers nor copywriters like hyphenation very much, but it is sometimes needed to prevent rag problems (there is a description in the next tab). 
 
If you have to use hyphens: 

- - avoid having a lot of them in a block of copy 

- - especially avoid having one follow another 

_Rag_ 

Rag refers to the uneven vertical edge of a block of type. Since text is normally left-aligned, rag can usually be seen along the right-hand edge. It is important to pay attention to the rag because it can make it difficult for the viewer to read the text. Usually, it can easily be fixed by reworking the line breaks or by editing the copy. 
 
Look at the examples below. They may look quite similar to an untrained eye, but can you see that the edge of the paragraph on the left-hand side is more uneven than the one on the right? If you struggle to see it, squint a little. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 18. An example of rag._

_Widows and orphans_ 

- - WIDOW - If a single word or short line of copy is left at the end of a column, it is called a widow.  

- - ORPHAN - If a single word or a short line of copy appears at the top of the following column, it is called an orphan.  

Both are considered bad typography because they create distracting shapes in a block of type. They can usually be easily fixed in the same way as the rag: by reworking the line breaks in the column or by editing the copy. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 19. An example of an orphan and a widow_

## Type families

The term “type family” refers to all the variations of a typeface or font, like different weights, widths, and italics. Type families are useful design tools because they offer designers a set of variations that work together to create harmony and clean designs. To give an artwork a feeling of unity, many designers restrict themselves to using only two type families in a project. This creates a typographic hierarchy. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 20. An example of a typeface family_

### Typeface variations 

Typefaces can have many weight variations. The naming of these variations can be quite confusing and abstract. What is the difference between a semi-bold and a medium? What about extra black, heavy, and ultra-black? The variety of names makes it hard to compare different weights from different families. This is one of the main reasons why Adrian Frutiger developed his special grid system. 

### Frutiger’s grid 

Adrian Frutiger is known for creating the Univers font family as well as a special numbering system to identify the width and weight of each of the family’s 21 original letters. He designed this numbering system to get rid of the confusion caused by different naming systems such as thin, black, heavy, etc. The diagram he created for the Univers family provides a sense of order between the different weight and width relationships. The grid uses numbers to identify the different cuts. Some of these numbers have been adopted by other typefaces and are still being used today. For example, the main numbers in Helvetica are 55 for Roman, 75 for bold, 35 for thin, and 25 for light. This grid system may seem daunting at first, but it can be quite a useful tool if you figure out how it works. 

### Using this system 

At first glance, the grid may seem complicated but it’s actually quite easy to understand once you get into the swing of things. Look at the grid below. The italic version of a font, 56, can be used seamlessly with its Roman, 55, for example. Varying character width is easily achieved by moving one row down the grid from 55 to 65, or if a bold is required, down to 75. 

### Numbering systems 

Frutiger’s numbering system has been applied to various typefaces, including Frutiger’s Serifa, Avenir, Glyphic, Frutiger and Helvetica Neue. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 21. Frutiger’s grid (James Brook, 2011)_

### Combining type weights

The grid is especially useful for combining different types of weights. The 65 is different enough from the 45 to stand apart from it, plus moving to italics, 46, can be done seamlessly. The difference between 25 and 95 might be too great for general usage, but it can perhaps be used to create a specific effect. The beauty of the grid is that even when choosing a heavier cut like 95, an italic option is instantly available in 96. Visual harmony is produced by combining weights that are two places apart from each other on the grid, like 65 and 45. Weights that are too similar, for example, 65 and 55, should preferably not be used together.

Training your eyes to see what works and what doesn’t, takes time. And as with everything in life, the more you practise the better you’ll get. This is particularly true when it comes to design, especially the art in typography and colour. Hopefully, after these lessons you will see colour more clearly and look at typography in a different way.

Knowing and understanding classification is important, but it is not always enough to make a decision on choosing the right typefaces. 
 
In his book Design for Hackers, David Kadavy suggests that we focus more on the overall structure of letterforms to understand the mood a typeface communicates.

## Lesson-Font pairings, usability and the style tile

## Lesson Overview

### Lesson - Font pairings, usability and the style tile 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

### Introduction 

Typography is when letters and text are arranged that makes information legible, clear and aesthetically pleasing. One needs to consider the role typography plays, and choose fonts for the headings and body content text that works well together. 
 
In this lesson, we will: 

- - take a look at pairing different fonts 

- - see how to use custom web fonts for your design 

- - take a look at the style tile where we will take everything discussed in the previous lessons and put it all together in one design deliverable. 

|     | NOTE<br><br>This lesson contains 5 activities that you should complete. |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |

|     | NOTE<br><br>The right choice for your typography on your website is essential. Not only from an aesthetic point of view (if it looks good and suits the genre of the site) but also from a functional and usable point of view (is it easy to read for users and clear enough). Aesthetics and usability need to work together to form the perfect fit for the brand and the target audience. |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Headings 

**For headings, one can choose expressive, unique fonts to add personality to the website. These fonts should stand out to the user and be prominent on the page. There should be a distinction between the headings and the body text. Often, decorative fonts are used for headings, as they can be fun and artistic.** 
 
**But before you go crazy with the decorative fonts, make sure they are:** 

- - **Easy to read.** 

- - **In-line with the corporate identity of the client.** 

- - **Relevant to the target audience the client wants to reach.** 

Keep in mind that most online users scan through information. If a headline consists of a font that is too intricate and hard to read, the user may be confused and, in the end, waste time trying to figure out what the headline is communicating. It’s never a good idea to let the user think too long about information.  

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 1. An example of a decorative font._

Serif fonts are usually used for headings as they have small lines on the letters giving the font character. They stand out more and are a good choice for headings. But again, it’s crucial to consider the brand. Would a serif font appeal to a company selling dirt bikes or would it be better suited to a bookstore? The bookstore would most likely be the best fit. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2. The serif font fits the genre of the brand better._

## Body text

The content text for your website should be clean and legible with proper spacing between letters and lines. Sans serif fonts are the right choice as they are quite readable and simple fonts. 
 
Cursive and handwriting fonts can be harder to read in more significant blocks of text. Reserve these fonts for specific areas or use them for only a select few words, such as for quotations. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 3. Cursive and handwriting fonts are harder to read._

## Font pairings 

**Choose fonts that:** 

- - **complement each other.** 

- - **appeal to your target audience.** 

- - **match the genre of the website.**                                      

Often sans serif fonts are used for the content text of the page, and serif fonts used for the headings. Contrast is useful, for example, if you are using a decorative font for headings, it would be good to use a simple sans serif font for the body text. 
 
You can pair a subtle, simple typeface for the body text with a bold font for the headings. 
 
Using too many fonts on the website may confuse users and clutter the design. Using only two to three fonts is optimal, with a primary font for the headings, a secondary font for the main body text, and an accent font used in specific places on the web page, such as for calls to action and quotes. 

## Keep the hierarchy in mind 

Hierarchy in typography is arranging the text in order of importance. The word hierarchy is fundamental in the world of design. It’s important because it helps to convey a sequence for the user visually. The user needs to know by looking at the design which text is more important and therefore, which text needs to be read first. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4. Hierarchy with typography._

Hierarchy can be achieved by enriching your typography in a few different ways: 

## Amount of typefaces 

Too many typefaces used on a webpage can be confusing and have a cluttered effect. Keep to two or three fonts and have the roles consistent, e.g. the same font used throughout for headings helps the user read through the design quickly.  

## Font sizes 

**Contrast occurs when differentiating between the two typefaces for headings and body.** 
 
**It can be achieved with:** 

- - **The type of typefaces, e.g. serif vs sans serif.** 

- - **With colour, e.g. having the heading a different brighter colour, telling our eyes which is primary, and which is secondary. Warm colours advance and cool colours recede.** 

- - **With styles and weights, e.g. using different styling for different types of text with regards to bold, italics, letter case, and other style attributes.** 

In the above example, we have a different creative font used for the headings, compared to a simple serif font used for the body text. The headings are more significant than the content text, in font size and weight. The thicker and bolder letters help emphasise the headings on the page and there is colour added in the heading. This allows the first couple of words to stand out.  

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5. A good example of contrast._

### Space 

An easy design mistake to make is a lack of space or using incorrect spacing. Proximity is important but good spacing is key for clarity to achieve hierarchy in typography. 
 
Creating space helps the user understand the layout better. Having the page too busy with too much text can make the user feel overwhelmed and they may not want to spend any more time on the page. Having paragraph spacing between the main heading and the content text will give much-needed breathing space and make the overall design more user friendly. 

## Usability 

Usability is often spoken about in website design, including layout, colours, and functionality of the pages. The text on your website page and the way you show text also needs to be considered. Here we go through a few points of what not to do with website text: 

### Avoid small text  

If a website text is not legible, the user won't be able to use your website. Make sure the text is easy to read for everyone. 
 
Remember that not all typefaces/font choices are the same with regards to their sizing, for example 16px Verdana may be smaller than 16px of a different font. Responsive testing of the website is needed to check if your text is readable on smaller screens. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 6. The difference between bigger text and text that is too small._

### Justifying text 

Justifying text may work in print design, but it is something to avoid in website design. Justifying text spreads out the words so they fill the whole content block, but this creates big uneven spaces between the words. The text becomes difficult to read for users and is considered bad typography.  

### Centre alignment of text 

Text that is centre aligned is generally harder to read because the eye works harder to find where the line begins to continue reading. Centre alignment can be used on a headline but should be avoided on long blocks to text.  

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 7. Centre aligned text vs. Left aligned text._

### Text on image 

Text on images can be hard to read for the online user. If needed for text on images use a colour overlay to create a better contrast between text and image. 

### Using the wrong contrast in fonts  

Avoid using low contrast, i.e. dark text on a dark background or light text on a light background. Reverse type should be used sparingly. Studies show that it's much better to use black text on white, compared to white text on black. Sometimes reverse type can bring in a dramatic feel to the page, but it should be used sparingly and specifically for areas with minimal or bigger text. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 8. Dark text on a dark background colour is hard to read._

### Long line length   

Make sure you have a good amount of characters on each line, as this is important for usability. When the text line is too long, readers have difficulty focusing on the text itself. Studies show that the optimal line length should be 50 - 60 characters for a good user experience on a normal laptop or PC screen. 
 
For smaller screen sizes, i.e. mobile, this number would obviously be less. Too narrow can also make the website text uncomfortable to read. 

### Avoid all caps  

Having all your letters capitalised makes it harder for your user to read the text. It actually slows down the time it takes to read the content. Also, it gives the impression of shouting which is not a friendly user experience. If you need to use capital letters in some words, make sure not to write the text in caps but make use of the CSS text-transform property to change the style easily later.  

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 9. Using lowercase in paragraph text is a lot easier to read_

## Finding fonts for your design 

### Google fonts  

Google fonts host the fonts on their servers. The service is free, has no issues with licensing, and you don't need an account to use their website. 
 
They have a wide range of custom fonts to choose from and are categorised for easy searching. Google fonts also give you the code you need to use, making the process very simple and easy. 
 
The fonts can also be downloaded to use in graphics programs and for print. 
 
Google fonts offer good support for browsers: 

- - Google Chrome: version 4.249.4+ 

- - Mozilla Firefox: version: 3.5+ 

- - Apple Safari: version 3.1+ 

- - Opera: version 10.5+ 

- - Microsoft Internet Explorer: version 6+. 

There are some disadvantages to using Google fonts: 

- - They may slow down the rendering speed of your pages 

- - Many websites use Google fonts, so you will see your font choice in other websites 

- - The fonts are widely used, so best to avoid using the fonts in actual brand typography, for example in logos. 

- - As the fonts are hosted elsewhere, if the service goes down there is nothing much you can do. 

### Using Google fonts for your website 

Go to the Google fonts website and search for a font. Make use of the categories section to refine your search - as you can select categories like serif, sans serif, handwriting and others. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 10. Google fonts (Google Fonts, 2020)_

Choose your font and click on the + icon. A great way to preview your font and test out the fonts is to highlight the text and write your own text in its place. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 11. Applying a sample of text to all fonts (Google Fonts, 2020)_

The embed tab shows the code to use. Copy and paste this code into your HTML and CSS files. There is link code for your font, which you can use in the <head> tag of your html page. There is a standard option or import option. 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 12. The embed tab showing the code (Google Fonts, 2020)._

There is also CSS code for you to use in your CSS stylesheet. This CSS may then be applied as classes to various aspects of a pages, such to specific paragraphs, heading or all body text. 

### @font-face 

@font-face is another way to use a font which the website user does not have installed. To use @font-face you must host the font on your server. 
 
You should first find a font you want to use, download it, and then upload the font file to your webserver. 
 
Browser support needs to be taken into consideration. Therefore, it is recommended to find and use fonts that are TTF, OTF, and WOFF as they are better supported on modern browsers. 

### Variable fonts 

Variable fonts give designers the option of a range of font variants in a single font file. =Web fonts at the moment store each variation of a font in a separate file, for example: Roboto-Bold.ttf, Roboto-light.ttf, and there is not much variety. 
 
Variable fonts offer this as a single file and gives more flexibility with weight, slant, grade, width, and other axis. 
 
With CSS3, one can use the font-stretch property with different values which - until variable fonts came along - one could only use the values specified when providing different font files for each width.

## Communicating through style tiles 

Over the last couple of weeks, you have learned much about layout principals, colour, content management, and typography in design.  As designers and developers, we spend many hours consulting with clients to design and develop websites that meet the requirements of the brand while attracting the right target market. All these meetings and hours spent consulting, asking questions, going back and forth is meaningless if all stakeholders don't agree on the specific design elements that should represent their business's brand in the best possible way. We use a style tile to deliver certain design elements to clients to ensure everybody agrees with regards to which design elements best represent the needs of the business. 

_What is a style tile?_ 

A style tile is a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colours and UI elements such as buttons, links and icons, to name a few. It is more intricate than a mood board and less complicated than a website mock-up. In other words, a style tile is a tool that is used as a visual language between the designers and the stakeholders. It serves as a discussion point around the goal the client wants to achieve in terms of brand and target audience. 

_Why use a style tile?_ 

Not only does a style tile serve as an essential design deliverable, but it also keeps stakeholders involved in the design process. It’s a great way to communicate creative choices with regards to a website in a framework that’s easy for clients to understand. A style tile is adjustable and helps to sketch the scene through fonts, colours, and other elements. Apart from the essential visual aspects, a style tile is an excellent conversation initiator between designer and client. 

_Style tile elements_ 

A Style tile consists of the following: 

- - Client Logo: Even though the style tile is not a mock-up, it's still a client presentation. Therefore, it's essential to brand for the specific client. 

- - Fonts: Typography plays a vital role on any website. Fonts that are easy to read and complement the overall brand should be considered. Use this part to show how headings, subheadings, and body text would look. 

- - Colours: This can be colours that already exist with regards to the brand or a selection of new colours that the client wants to add to the site. 

- - Icons: A set of icons that are clear about what they represent and in which direction each one would take the online visitor. 

- - Hyperlinks: If you are planning to use hyperlinks on the website, it should be communicated to the client on how they would look. 

- - Buttons: Call to action buttons such as "Sign up", "Add to cart" and "Learn more" buttons are some of the essential buttons present on websites. It's best to show the client how these will look on hover and in a normal state. 

- - Adjectives: Some might argue that this is the most crucial part of the style tile. These words consist of the most important characteristics that describe the client, brand, and website. 

- - Images: Photography on any website is an excellent way to make the site more appealing but also useful to show the online user how products look that is on offer.  

- - Textures: An example of a pattern or texture if applicable, can be included on the style tile. 

- - Version number: All style tiles should have a version number along with the project name. This is useful to eliminate confusion and combine elements from other versions. For example, say you have designed three versions, but the client feels the font from version one is more relevant to the brand. Still, they like everything else from version three than it's easier for the designer to make changes to the style tile.  

It's vital to show the client what these elements would look like on their website in as much detail as possible. For example, what would a call to action button look like on hover and what would it look like in a normal state? Which font would be used for a headline and which one for the body text? Would the icons change colour on hover? All this needs to be communicated to the client through the design of the Style Tile. The overall layout should be easy to interpret and to understand; elements should be appropriately aligned and arranged in such a way that’s easy for the client to understand.  

|     | INFO<br><br>A style tile is not meant to look like a finished website or even a finished home page. It should instead focus on the design elements that would be present throughout the site. |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Where to start? 

The first step is to ask questions and ensure an open communication channel between crucial role players. The reason for creating a new website should be apparent, and the client should provide you with adequate goals as to why the development of a new site is required. Examples of questions (and answers) which the new design may address are as follows: 

GOALS 

What is the most critical goal(s) of the new site?  

- To build the brand 

- To increase sales 

- To become a reliable source 

TARGET AUDIENCE 

Who is the target audience? 
 
Proper demographics like age, race, gender, marital status, household income and employment of the desired target audience is extremely helpful. For example: is your client targeting females aged between 20 and 35? Are they typically married and have children? Are they employed or self-employed and earning around 100 000 NOK a year? 

PERCEPTIONS / FEELINGS 

How does the client want the target audience to feel about their website? What is the perception the business wants to create through the site? What type of brand identity does the client want to be reflected on the site? For example: 
 
Pleasant - The website is easy to navigate and finding important information is a breeze.  
Trustworthy - The site is secure, safe to buy from and delivery times were as promised.   
Informative - The website is a reliable source of credible and educational information. 

COMPETITION 

Who is the competition, and what do they do? What would set your client apart from them in the marketplace? For example, Company XYZ has been in the market longer and is loved by locals. Their product is of good quality, but limited. Your client offers a more significant range of products with a more suitable price tag.  

MESSAGE 

What message does your client want to send to the target audience? What are the key things they want them to know about their brand? For example: Be the athlete you always wanted to be. This lets the audience know that they will be assisted during every step of their journey by professional staff / this lets the audience know that the client caters to amateur as well as professional athletes. 

CLIENT PREFERENCES 

Is there any design preference the client prefers? What do they like and what do they dislike? What other websites do they find inspiring? For example, The client would like their company colours to be present throughout the site. They want simple and modern fonts and dislike serif fonts. Images should be true-to-life and spontaneous, i.e. they shouldn’t seem staged.  

### Finding characteristics 

After consulting with your client, you should have a clear idea what their business and brand is all about, who the target audience is they want to reach through their website, how they want the target audience to feel when entering their site and what message they want to convey. The information provided by the client should now guide you to compile a list of adjectives that will help you with characteristics that you’ll present on the style tile in the form of graphics. We’ll explore this further in the example on the next page. 

## Putting it all together 

Let's look at the following company, see what their adjectives would be and how they would be presented on a style tile using creative elements. 
 
Funky Monkey is a company that designs and manufactures socks. These socks are not your average dull, grey, black or navy socks, but rather a statement piece. Their business goal is to become a well-known brand amongst athletes and individuals that like to make a fashion statement. 
 
Their target market is the following: 

- Are males and females  

- Aged 25 to 35  

- Want to take part in sports such as mountain biking, triathlons, and marathons  

- Wish to make a statement with regards to their fashion choices 

Funky Monkey socks are bright and bold; they are of good quality, comfortable, and durable to withstand the toughest workout and trendy enough to impress during a business meeting. They can be worn with almost any style of shoe, even sandals and are 100% breathable. They consist of unique designs which are the primary feature of the product. 
 
The message the client wants to send their target audience is "Be unique. Be bold. Be a funky monkey." The client would like a website that accommodates online purchases. They want the customer to feel excited about the product and would like the brand to bring a sense of uniqueness to individuals that purchase the product. 
 
The brand's adjectives are the following: 

- Unique 

- Bold 

- Fashionable 

- Durable 

- Colourful 

We’ll be using all the information that Funky Monkey has provided to put together a style tile. But first, let's have a look at possible grid and layout options. 
 
Ensure that you present the information in a way that is easy for the client to understand and effortless to follow. Look at the examples below: 

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 14. Style tile three-column grid and layout example._

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 15.  Style tile two-column grid and layout example._

Both layout examples are easy to follow and easy to understand. The various design elements are placed in a way that clearly differentiates between multiple components. Now let’s use one of the grid and layout examples above and create the Style tile for Funky Monkey: 

Step one: Add the logo to the style tile. 

Step two: Add a colour palette.  

Step three: Look for and add images and texture/patterns to the style tile. Images can be product shots or lifestyle photos. 

Step four: Add icons. It's better to add icons that will be used for navigational purposes or that completes an action rather than adding icons that serve no purpose but merely look nice. Focus on icons such as a search icon, home icon, contact icon, chart icon, to name a few.  

Step five: Add call to action buttons. Show the client what a button would look on hover as well as normal state. 

Step six: Add typography. The chosen fonts should be easy to read and complement the overall feel of the brand. 

Step seven: Add the brand's adjectives. Try to have some fun with these and choose fonts that would best describe the selected words. 

See the completed style tile for Funky Monkey below:

### Brief 

Design a style tile for your client presenting them with the various design elements you intend to use on their website. Your style tile should be easy to comprehend, and the information presented should be relevant to the business of the client and the target audience the client wants to reach through the website. 
 
The style tile should consist of the following design elements: 

- A simple logo. 

- A colour palette. 

- Typography choices. 

- Icons and buttons. 

- Photos and textures. 

- Hyperlinks. 

- Brand Adjectives. 

### Process 

- Analyse the challenge and consider the target audience of the web page. 

- If you are unsure about what a style tile is refer back to Lesson 2.4 'Font Pairings, Usability and the Style Tile'.
