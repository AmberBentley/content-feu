## Goal

To put into practice what you have learned about design, create a basic wireframe and build a working prototype of your website.

## Brief

In Design Module Assignment 2, you will have chosen one of the following briefs:

- https://github.com/NoroffFEU/first-year-cross-course-assignment-brief-one

- https://github.com/NoroffFEU/first-year-cross-course-assignment-brief-two

- https://github.com/NoroffFEU/first-year-cross-course-assignment-brief-three

Now, for your Course Assignment, you have been tasked with creating a working prototype using Adobe XD/Figma. Each brief has a 'site architecture' that will show you which pages to create for your chosen brief. 

The prototype should be interactive, and it should be possible to click links and move between pages. If you have multiple pages where the layout look the same (for example, product pages), you only need to create one version of that page for the prototype.

If you are using the free version of Adobe XD it's important to note that you can only have one active shared prototype.

## Level 1 Process

- Take the feedback you received on your fonts/icons and colours you made for your Cross-Course lesson and consider if you need to make any changes.

- Draw up wireframes of the various pages - you can do this on paper or use your computer, whatever works best for you.

- Make a desktop and mobile-view prototype using Adobe XD/Figma - you can make them in the same project so that you can deliver one link.

- Create a shareable link for your prototype.

- Write a report explaining your decisions and thinking behind your final delivery.

## Submission

- A link to your prototype/s shared submitted on Moodle.

- Please include a PDF report on the process you went through to complete this CA and the final product.

- Your report should include a reflection on your submission and must have at least the following main sections:

– introduction

– body

– conclusion

– references (if applicable).

Your report must be 700-1 000 words.
