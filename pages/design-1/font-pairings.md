## Lesson-Font pairings, usability and the style tile

## Lesson Overview

### Lesson - Font pairings, usability and the style tile

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

### Introduction

Typography is when letters and text are arranged that makes information legible, clear and aesthetically pleasing. One needs to consider the role typography plays, and choose fonts for the headings and body content text that works well together.

In this lesson, we will:

- - take a look at pairing different fonts

- - see how to use custom web fonts for your design

- - take a look at the style tile where we will take everything discussed in the previous lessons and put it all together in one design deliverable.

|     | NOTE<br><br>This lesson contains 5 activities that you should complete. |

|  | NOTE<br><br>The right choice for your typography on your website is essential. Not only from an aesthetic point of view (if it looks good and suits the genre of the site) but also from a functional and usable point of view (is it easy to read for users and clear enough). Aesthetics and usability need to work together to form the perfect fit for the brand and the target audience. |

## Headings

**For headings, one can choose expressive, unique fonts to add personality to the website. These fonts should stand out to the user and be prominent on the page. There should be a distinction between the headings and the body text. Often, decorative fonts are used for headings, as they can be fun and artistic.**

**But before you go crazy with the decorative fonts, make sure they are:**

- - **Easy to read.**

- - **In-line with the corporate identity of the client.**

- - **Relevant to the target audience the client wants to reach.**

Keep in mind that most online users scan through information. If a headline consists of a font that is too intricate and hard to read, the user may be confused and, in the end, waste time trying to figure out what the headline is communicating. It’s never a good idea to let the user think too long about information.

_Figure 1. An example of a decorative font._

Serif fonts are usually used for headings as they have small lines on the letters giving the font character. They stand out more and are a good choice for headings. But again, it’s crucial to consider the brand. Would a serif font appeal to a company selling dirt bikes or would it be better suited to a bookstore? The bookstore would most likely be the best fit.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2. The serif font fits the genre of the brand better._

## Body text

The content text for your website should be clean and legible with proper spacing between letters and lines. Sans serif fonts are the right choice as they are quite readable and simple fonts.

Cursive and handwriting fonts can be harder to read in more significant blocks of text. Reserve these fonts for specific areas or use them for only a select few words, such as for quotations.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 3. Cursive and handwriting fonts are harder to read._

## Font pairings

**Choose fonts that:**

- - **complement each other.**

- - **appeal to your target audience.**

- - **match the genre of the website.**

Often sans serif fonts are used for the content text of the page, and serif fonts used for the headings. Contrast is useful, for example, if you are using a decorative font for headings, it would be good to use a simple sans serif font for the body text.

You can pair a subtle, simple typeface for the body text with a bold font for the headings.

Using too many fonts on the website may confuse users and clutter the design. Using only two to three fonts is optimal, with a primary font for the headings, a secondary font for the main body text, and an accent font used in specific places on the web page, such as for calls to action and quotes.

## Keep the hierarchy in mind

Hierarchy in typography is arranging the text in order of importance. The word hierarchy is fundamental in the world of design. It’s important because it helps to convey a sequence for the user visually. The user needs to know by looking at the design which text is more important and therefore, which text needs to be read first.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4. Hierarchy with typography._

Hierarchy can be achieved by enriching your typography in a few different ways:

## Amount of typefaces

Too many typefaces used on a webpage can be confusing and have a cluttered effect. Keep to two or three fonts and have the roles consistent, e.g. the same font used throughout for headings helps the user read through the design quickly.

## Font sizes

**Contrast occurs when differentiating between the two typefaces for headings and body.**

**It can be achieved with:**

- - **The type of typefaces, e.g. serif vs sans serif.**

- - **With colour, e.g. having the heading a different brighter colour, telling our eyes which is primary, and which is secondary. Warm colours advance and cool colours recede.**

- - **With styles and weights, e.g. using different styling for different types of text with regards to bold, italics, letter case, and other style attributes.**

In the above example, we have a different creative font used for the headings, compared to a simple serif font used for the body text. The headings are more significant than the content text, in font size and weight. The thicker and bolder letters help emphasise the headings on the page and there is colour added in the heading. This allows the first couple of words to stand out.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5. A good example of contrast._

### Space

An easy design mistake to make is a lack of space or using incorrect spacing. Proximity is important but good spacing is key for clarity to achieve hierarchy in typography.

Creating space helps the user understand the layout better. Having the page too busy with too much text can make the user feel overwhelmed and they may not want to spend any more time on the page. Having paragraph spacing between the main heading and the content text will give much-needed breathing space and make the overall design more user friendly.

## Usability

Usability is often spoken about in website design, including layout, colours, and functionality of the pages. The text on your website page and the way you show text also needs to be considered. Here we go through a few points of what not to do with website text:

### Avoid small text

If a website text is not legible, the user won't be able to use your website. Make sure the text is easy to read for everyone.

Remember that not all typefaces/font choices are the same with regards to their sizing, for example 16px Verdana may be smaller than 16px of a different font. Responsive testing of the website is needed to check if your text is readable on smaller screens.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 6. The difference between bigger text and text that is too small._

### Justifying text

Justifying text may work in print design, but it is something to avoid in website design. Justifying text spreads out the words so they fill the whole content block, but this creates big uneven spaces between the words. The text becomes difficult to read for users and is considered bad typography.

### Centre alignment of text

Text that is centre aligned is generally harder to read because the eye works harder to find where the line begins to continue reading. Centre alignment can be used on a headline but should be avoided on long blocks to text.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 7. Centre aligned text vs. Left aligned text._

### Text on image

Text on images can be hard to read for the online user. If needed for text on images use a colour overlay to create a better contrast between text and image.

### Using the wrong contrast in fonts

Avoid using low contrast, i.e. dark text on a dark background or light text on a light background. Reverse type should be used sparingly. Studies show that it's much better to use black text on white, compared to white text on black. Sometimes reverse type can bring in a dramatic feel to the page, but it should be used sparingly and specifically for areas with minimal or bigger text.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 8. Dark text on a dark background colour is hard to read._

### Long line length

Make sure you have a good amount of characters on each line, as this is important for usability. When the text line is too long, readers have difficulty focusing on the text itself. Studies show that the optimal line length should be 50 - 60 characters for a good user experience on a normal laptop or PC screen.

For smaller screen sizes, i.e. mobile, this number would obviously be less. Too narrow can also make the website text uncomfortable to read.

### Avoid all caps

Having all your letters capitalised makes it harder for your user to read the text. It actually slows down the time it takes to read the content. Also, it gives the impression of shouting which is not a friendly user experience. If you need to use capital letters in some words, make sure not to write the text in caps but make use of the CSS text-transform property to change the style easily later.

## Finding fonts for your design

### Google fonts

Google fonts host the fonts on their servers. The service is free, has no issues with licensing, and you don't need an account to use their website.

They have a wide range of custom fonts to choose from and are categorised for easy searching. Google fonts also give you the code you need to use, making the process very simple and easy.

The fonts can also be downloaded to use in graphics programs and for print.

Google fonts offer good support for browsers:

- - Google Chrome: version 4.249.4+

- - Mozilla Firefox: version: 3.5+

- - Apple Safari: version 3.1+

- - Opera: version 10.5+

- - Microsoft Internet Explorer: version 6+.

There are some disadvantages to using Google fonts:

- - They may slow down the rendering speed of your pages

- - Many websites use Google fonts, so you will see your font choice in other websites

- - The fonts are widely used, so best to avoid using the fonts in actual brand typography, for example in logos.

- - As the fonts are hosted elsewhere, if the service goes down there is nothing much you can do.

### Using Google fonts for your website

Go to the Google fonts website and search for a font. Make use of the categories section to refine your search - as you can select categories like serif, sans serif, handwriting and others.

_Figure 10. Google fonts (Google Fonts, 2020)_

Choose your font and click on the + icon. A great way to preview your font and test out the fonts is to highlight the text and write your own text in its place.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 11. Applying a sample of text to all fonts (Google Fonts, 2020)_

The embed tab shows the code to use. Copy and paste this code into your HTML and CSS files. There is link code for your font, which you can use in the <head> tag of your html page. There is a standard option or import option.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 12. The embed tab showing the code (Google Fonts, 2020)._

There is also CSS code for you to use in your CSS stylesheet. This CSS may then be applied as classes to various aspects of a pages, such to specific paragraphs, heading or all body text.

### @font-face

@font-face is another way to use a font which the website user does not have installed. To use @font-face you must host the font on your server.

You should first find a font you want to use, download it, and then upload the font file to your webserver.

Browser support needs to be taken into consideration. Therefore, it is recommended to find and use fonts that are TTF, OTF, and WOFF as they are better supported on modern browsers.

### Variable fonts

Variable fonts give designers the option of a range of font variants in a single font file. =Web fonts at the moment store each variation of a font in a separate file, for example: Roboto-Bold.ttf, Roboto-light.ttf, and there is not much variety.

Variable fonts offer this as a single file and gives more flexibility with weight, slant, grade, width, and other axis.

With CSS3, one can use the font-stretch property with different values which - until variable fonts came along - one could only use the values specified when providing different font files for each width.

## Communicating through style tiles

Over the last couple of weeks, you have learned much about layout principals, colour, content management, and typography in design. As designers and developers, we spend many hours consulting with clients to design and develop websites that meet the requirements of the brand while attracting the right target market. All these meetings and hours spent consulting, asking questions, going back and forth is meaningless if all stakeholders don't agree on the specific design elements that should represent their business's brand in the best possible way. We use a style tile to deliver certain design elements to clients to ensure everybody agrees with regards to which design elements best represent the needs of the business.

_What is a style tile?_

A style tile is a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colours and UI elements such as buttons, links and icons, to name a few. It is more intricate than a mood board and less complicated than a website mock-up. In other words, a style tile is a tool that is used as a visual language between the designers and the stakeholders. It serves as a discussion point around the goal the client wants to achieve in terms of brand and target audience.

_Why use a style tile?_

Not only does a style tile serve as an essential design deliverable, but it also keeps stakeholders involved in the design process. It’s a great way to communicate creative choices with regards to a website in a framework that’s easy for clients to understand. A style tile is adjustable and helps to sketch the scene through fonts, colours, and other elements. Apart from the essential visual aspects, a style tile is an excellent conversation initiator between designer and client.

_Style tile elements_

A Style tile consists of the following:

- - Client Logo: Even though the style tile is not a mock-up, it's still a client presentation. Therefore, it's essential to brand for the specific client.

- - Fonts: Typography plays a vital role on any website. Fonts that are easy to read and complement the overall brand should be considered. Use this part to show how headings, subheadings, and body text would look.

- - Colours: This can be colours that already exist with regards to the brand or a selection of new colours that the client wants to add to the site.

- - Icons: A set of icons that are clear about what they represent and in which direction each one would take the online visitor.

- - Hyperlinks: If you are planning to use hyperlinks on the website, it should be communicated to the client on how they would look.

- - Buttons: Call to action buttons such as "Sign up", "Add to cart" and "Learn more" buttons are some of the essential buttons present on websites. It's best to show the client how these will look on hover and in a normal state.

- - Adjectives: Some might argue that this is the most crucial part of the style tile. These words consist of the most important characteristics that describe the client, brand, and website.

- - Images: Photography on any website is an excellent way to make the site more appealing but also useful to show the online user how products look that is on offer.

- - Textures: An example of a pattern or texture if applicable, can be included on the style tile.

- - Version number: All style tiles should have a version number along with the project name. This is useful to eliminate confusion and combine elements from other versions. For example, say you have designed three versions, but the client feels the font from version one is more relevant to the brand. Still, they like everything else from version three than it's easier for the designer to make changes to the style tile.

It's vital to show the client what these elements would look like on their website in as much detail as possible. For example, what would a call to action button look like on hover and what would it look like in a normal state? Which font would be used for a headline and which one for the body text? Would the icons change colour on hover? All this needs to be communicated to the client through the design of the Style Tile. The overall layout should be easy to interpret and to understand; elements should be appropriately aligned and arranged in such a way that’s easy for the client to understand.

|  | INFO<br><br>A style tile is not meant to look like a finished website or even a finished home page. It should instead focus on the design elements that would be present throughout the site. |
| :-: | :-- |

## Where to start?

The first step is to ask questions and ensure an open communication channel between crucial role players. The reason for creating a new website should be apparent, and the client should provide you with adequate goals as to why the development of a new site is required. Examples of questions (and answers) which the new design may address are as follows:

GOALS

What is the most critical goal(s) of the new site?

- To build the brand

- To increase sales

- To become a reliable source

TARGET AUDIENCE

Who is the target audience?

Proper demographics like age, race, gender, marital status, household income and employment of the desired target audience is extremely helpful. For example: is your client targeting females aged between 20 and 35? Are they typically married and have children? Are they employed or self-employed and earning around 100 000 NOK a year?

PERCEPTIONS / FEELINGS

How does the client want the target audience to feel about their website? What is the perception the business wants to create through the site? What type of brand identity does the client want to be reflected on the site? For example:

Pleasant - The website is easy to navigate and finding important information is a breeze.  
Trustworthy - The site is secure, safe to buy from and delivery times were as promised.  
Informative - The website is a reliable source of credible and educational information.

COMPETITION

Who is the competition, and what do they do? What would set your client apart from them in the marketplace? For example, Company XYZ has been in the market longer and is loved by locals. Their product is of good quality, but limited. Your client offers a more significant range of products with a more suitable price tag.

MESSAGE

What message does your client want to send to the target audience? What are the key things they want them to know about their brand? For example: Be the athlete you always wanted to be. This lets the audience know that they will be assisted during every step of their journey by professional staff / this lets the audience know that the client caters to amateur as well as professional athletes.

CLIENT PREFERENCES

Is there any design preference the client prefers? What do they like and what do they dislike? What other websites do they find inspiring? For example, The client would like their company colours to be present throughout the site. They want simple and modern fonts and dislike serif fonts. Images should be true-to-life and spontaneous, i.e. they shouldn’t seem staged.

### Finding characteristics

After consulting with your client, you should have a clear idea what their business and brand is all about, who the target audience is they want to reach through their website, how they want the target audience to feel when entering their site and what message they want to convey. The information provided by the client should now guide you to compile a list of adjectives that will help you with characteristics that you’ll present on the style tile in the form of graphics. We’ll explore this further in the example on the next page.

## Putting it all together

Let's look at the following company, see what their adjectives would be and how they would be presented on a style tile using creative elements.

Funky Monkey is a company that designs and manufactures socks. These socks are not your average dull, grey, black or navy socks, but rather a statement piece. Their business goal is to become a well-known brand amongst athletes and individuals that like to make a fashion statement.

Their target market is the following:

- Are males and females

- Aged 25 to 35

- Want to take part in sports such as mountain biking, triathlons, and marathons

- Wish to make a statement with regards to their fashion choices

Funky Monkey socks are bright and bold; they are of good quality, comfortable, and durable to withstand the toughest workout and trendy enough to impress during a business meeting. They can be worn with almost any style of shoe, even sandals and are 100% breathable. They consist of unique designs which are the primary feature of the product.

The message the client wants to send their target audience is "Be unique. Be bold. Be a funky monkey." The client would like a website that accommodates online purchases. They want the customer to feel excited about the product and would like the brand to bring a sense of uniqueness to individuals that purchase the product.

The brand's adjectives are the following:

- Unique

- Bold

- Fashionable

- Durable

- Colourful

We’ll be using all the information that Funky Monkey has provided to put together a style tile. But first, let's have a look at possible grid and layout options.

Ensure that you present the information in a way that is easy for the client to understand and effortless to follow. Look at the examples below:

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 14. Style tile three-column grid and layout example._

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 15. Style tile two-column grid and layout example._

Both layout examples are easy to follow and easy to understand. The various design elements are placed in a way that clearly differentiates between multiple components. Now let’s use one of the grid and layout examples above and create the Style tile for Funky Monkey:

Step one: Add the logo to the style tile.

Step two: Add a colour palette.

Step three: Look for and add images and texture/patterns to the style tile. Images can be product shots or lifestyle photos.

Step four: Add icons. It's better to add icons that will be used for navigational purposes or that completes an action rather than adding icons that serve no purpose but merely look nice. Focus on icons such as a search icon, home icon, contact icon, chart icon, to name a few.

Step five: Add call to action buttons. Show the client what a button would look on hover as well as normal state.

Step six: Add typography. The chosen fonts should be easy to read and complement the overall feel of the brand.

Step seven: Add the brand's adjectives. Try to have some fun with these and choose fonts that would best describe the selected words.

See the completed style tile for Funky Monkey below:

### Brief

Design a style tile for your client presenting them with the various design elements you intend to use on their website. Your style tile should be easy to comprehend, and the information presented should be relevant to the business of the client and the target audience the client wants to reach through the website.

The style tile should consist of the following design elements:

- A simple logo.

- A colour palette.

- Typography choices.

- Icons and buttons.

- Photos and textures.

- Hyperlinks.

- Brand Adjectives.

### Process

- Analyse the challenge and consider the target audience of the web page.

- If you are unsure about what a style tile is refer back to Lesson 2.4 'Font Pairings, Usability and the Style Tile'.

- Write down and sketch out some ideas.

- Do research on different typefaces to find the right mood and combinations. Don’t forget about the target audience.

- Create a color palette. Use ContrastChecker to make sure that your colors are WCAG compliant. Elements like text need to have enough contrast with the background color they’re placed on.

- Create design elements, such as icons and buttons for navigation, patterns, textures and images. Add a version number to the style tile.

- The images used on the Style tile should be resized before importing them to Adobe XD/Figma. For this purpose, you can use any raster graphics program, such as Adobe Photoshop.

- Open Adobe XD/Figma and create a 1920px x 1080px page.

- Think of the type of grid structure you want to use.

- It’s very important to ensure that all elements are correctly aligned and properly spaced out.

- Make sure the overall layout of the Style tile is easy to follow and easy to comprehend.

- You can download this Adobe XD template of a style tile to assist you in the process: Style Tile Adobe XD

- Generate a link to your style tile by clicking 'Share' on Adobe XD/Figma. The link generated is link you should submit on Moodle for assessment

### Submission

- A link to your style tile shared submitted on Moodle.

- Please include a PDF report on the process you went through to complete this MA and the final product. Your report should include reflection on your submission and must have at least the following main sections: introduction, body, conclusion, and references (if applicable). Your report must be 700-1000 words.
