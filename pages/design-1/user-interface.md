## Lesson - User interface design



## Lesson Overview

### Lesson - User interface design

### Introduction

This lesson will look at user interface design and how UI kits help designers create more consistent and appealing interfaces.

## What is UI design?

User interface design refers to the visual elements of a product. Simply put, it is the look and feel of a website. The branding for a company should come through in the user interface design to attract and engage the target audience.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 1. The interface of a banking app._

UI design is focused specifically on the point of contact where a human user interacts with a website or app. How the website looks and guides a user towards the page's goal is what UI design is all about.

## Example of UI design

A food ordering app's user interface is there to make the user feel good about ordering food and guides them towards satisfying their hunger.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2. Mr. Delivery Mobile food app._

The most crucial UI design aspect is to make the interaction between human (user) and software (product) easy and smooth while also keeping the look attractive and straightforward.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 3. An example of an app that helps users relax and fall asleep easily._

## UI elements

UI elements refer to the app or website's design elements that the user will be interacting with to reach the end goal. Examples of user interface elements include the following:

### Input controls

Input controls let the user input information on the website or app. An excellent example of input controls is list boxes, where users can select multiple items at once. Another good example is text fields where the user enters text like an email address, name, surname and phone number.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4. Input controls._

### Navigational components

Navigational components focus on steering the user in a specific direction. Any element that helps the user navigate the page may be seen as a navigational component.

Good examples are icons and pagination. When the user clicks on the cart's icon, they will be directed to the cart page, and when a user searches for an item, they will be directed to the search results page.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5: Navigational components._

### Informational components

Any form of communication with the user can be seen as an information component. This includes items such as the notification that an item was successfully added to your shopping cart. Information components inform the user of progress, give them tips on how to use specific tools and allow them to become involved with a brand by signing up for newsletters, for example.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") _Figure 6: Informational components._

### Containers

Containers are elements that contain other elements. One such design element is the accordion. An accordion consists of a list of items that are vertically stacked. Each of these elements hides a series of other design elements that are revealed when the user clicks on the accordion panel. More information is revealed when the specific accordion panel is activated by pushing existing page content further down the page.

_Figure 7: An example of an accordion._

### Interface inventory

Brad Frost coined the term 'interface inventory' and explained that it is similar to content inventory. However, instead of taking stock of a website's content such as text, images and documents, you will concentrate on the interface's design components, the bits and pieces that make up the website (Brad Frost, 2013). Interface inventories are useful since they help keep UI elements consistent and cohesive across the board.

You may be asking where and when this process starts. It can be for an existing website that needs to be updated or for a new website. In the case of a new website, you will be guided by what competitors are doing and what needs to be considered for the brand. Either way, it is vital to keep design choices and components consistent from start to finish.

## How to create an adequate interface inventory

### Screenshots

The process starts by taking screenshots of the design components. Every element needs to be added, from the smallest icon to more prominent components such as headers and images. Every component plays a role in the overall design and, therefore, should be included. The following are some interface components which should be considered:

- typography
- colours
- graphics and images
- media
- forms
- buttons
- tables
- navigation
- lists
- interactive components.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure. 8: An example of an interface inventory._

### Categorising and grouping components

The second step in the process is to take all the gathered screenshots and place them in different categories. For example, take all the screenshots you have gathered of the different buttons used on the website and place them all together in one document. You will quickly see if the style of the button is consistent across the website.

You should do this with all the interface components you have gathered. As you can see from figure 8, most of the components are consistent. Components that can use some tweaking are social media icons. Their colour is somewhat different to the colour palette and other icons on the site.

### Share, discuss and review

After gathering all the information and placing them in one document, assemble team members and perform a review. The review should give you a clear indication if elements are consistent or if they need to be investigated and refined more thoroughly.

## Pattern libraries and UI patterns

The inventory interface process helps us spot inconsistencies in the design, but it will also help recognise any recurring design patterns. A design pattern is employed when designers reuse elements to solve a problem in the user interface.

An excellent example of a UI pattern is breadcrumbs that assist the user with navigation by retracing the user's steps. Another example is the home link where the brand's logo is clickable and directs the user back to the homepage or the site's starting point.

With both these examples, the design pattern will be reused on almost every website page. Some examples of UI patterns include the following:

- password strength meter – to indicate whether the user's password is sufficient
- calendar picker – where a user can click on a specific date which will be highlighted and added
- module tabs – when content needs to be separated, users can then switch between the content sections by clicking on the tabs
- notifications – users are informed of important messages or updates by receiving a notification

- breadcrumbs – indicate where the user is on the site and how they can get back to where they started if needed
- home link – helps the user return to the start location - a brand’s logo is usually the home link
- carousel – allows the user to browse through a set of items and gives them the ability to select one
- pagination – gives users the ability to browse through a sorted list of products.

The UI pattern library is made up of many such design patterns. There are contrasting opinions as to whether these design patterns serve as a design system. Some believe it is the same as a brand's style guide.

To learn more about the broad range of design patterns and see examples of their usage, browse the website UI patterns here: [http://ui-patterns.com/patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns)

## Design systems

As mentioned, some may say a pattern library is the company's design system, but let's break it down and see what a design system consists of.

**Let's look at the design system as a container; there are three compartments inside: the visual design language, the pattern library and the style guide:**

**- The visual design language - refers to the brand's colour palette, typography, imagery and grid system, logo, and slogan, to name a few.**

**- Pattern library - refers to the collection of the recurring/reusable design patterns.**

**- Style guide - the rules and guidelines on how a brand's assets should be used. What is allowed with regards to typography, colour and the logo, for example? The style guide doesn't only focus on the visual aspect of things but also on how to write the content.**

Design systems are assembled in code and provide designers and developers with a complete guide, including design standards, documentation on which components must be used and how to use them.

## UI kits

A UI kit is a useful resource that can assist UI designers in designing an interface. UI kits are handy tools to get inspiration from and help save time in the design process. A UI kit consists of components such as fonts, icons, buttons, checkboxes, to name a few. Below is an example of Material Design UI kits that are open for designers to use.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") _Figure 9: Material Design UI kits (Source: [https://material.io/resources](https://material.io/resources))._

## Lesson Task - User Interface design

## Lesson Task

### Brief

Gather UI patterns and components for a food delivery app called Mobile Meals. You can decide if you want to design these yourself or if you want to use a UI kit.

The target audience for this app is aged between 25 and 35. They have busy schedules, so cooking time is limited and ordering food online is more convenient to accommodate their busy lifestyles. Popular restaurants include The PizzaGuy, The BurgerBar and PlatedFresh, a restaurant specialising in healthy food.

### Level 1 Process

- Conduct an interface inventory of similar apps to see what competitors in the market are doing. Please pay attention to what these competitors did right and what they did wrong regarding the UI elements. Furthermore, investigate if the general use of buttons, icons, typography, etc., is consistent across the site.
- Explore [https://www.xdguru.com/free-xd-ui-kits/](https://www.xdguru.com/free-xd-ui-kits/) for free UI kits or any other resource that you find helpful.
- Create a 1920 x 1080px artboard in Adobe XD/Figma. You can create multiple pages for your elements in Adobe XD/Figma or place all the elements on one page, depending on the number of elements you'll use to design the website.\*\*
- Think about what will be best with regards to colour, typography and imagery choices. Ensure these are used consistently throughout the design.\*\*

## Lesson Overview

## Lesson - Principles of User Interface design

![](https://c1h-word-edit-15.cdn.office.net/we/s/hA3596C17DAD9A003_resources/2057/progress.gif)

### Introduction

In this lesson, we will discuss the design principles that make a good UI design.

## UI principles

When designing a product interface, the golden rule is to keep it as simple as possible so that the user stays engaged. Simple doesn’t necessarily mean 'less content', but rather that design choices should be kept uncomplicated.

Here is where the KISS acronym is handy to keep in the back of your mind. KISS stands for 'keep it simple stupid', a design principle used by the U.S. Navy in 1960.

It’s believed the simpler a system is to use, the better it will work for the end-user. Simplicity should be considered a key goal in every design. When a design or system is simple to use, it makes for good user interaction and, in the end, a good user experience.

Let's look at some useful principles for interface designing.

## Simplicity and clarity

An interface should be intuitive, straightforward, and easy to understand. When a design is uncluttered, it's easier for the user to navigate the platform and quickly find what they are looking for. When there are too many elements and steps to reach the goal, it will overwhelm the user, creating the assumption that they need to 'work' to use the interface.

It's safe to say that users scan through information rather than read through it; therefore, as designers, we need to focus our attention on keeping the overall design as simple and straightforward as possible.

## Key questions

Here are some key question to ask yourself when designing an interface:

### **Could the interaction between the user interface and the user be more straightforward and more comfortable to use?**

Think of a website that uses a hamburger menu as the main navigation. On a mobile device, this is acceptable since the screen's size is small. On a desktop device, however, it creates an extra step for the user to perform.

Creating proper navigation that the user will see when they enter the site will make the interaction between interface and user faster and more comfortable. Look at the example below. When a user lands on the page, they will know exactly what the company is about and where each menu item will take them.

The interaction between the user and the interface immediately comes across as user-friendly and informative.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 1: Good navigation gives the user a clear indication of what they can achieve on the website (Source: [https://superbalist.com/women](https://superbalist.com/women))._

### Could the colour choice and images be more simple and less overwhelming?

As we have previously learned, colours and images are essential in the overall design of an interface. Not only for aesthetics, but the brand relies on these to tell its story. Having too many colours and images, on the other hand, will create a cluttered design.

Think of a website with a busy background image, and on top of this image is another image and on top of this is coloured text with bad contrast to the image. Not only will the user feel overwhelmed, but the overall design will look cluttered.

The example below demonstrates a design with bad colour use and an overall cluttered look and feel. The user won't know what to do or how to interact with the website. The choice in colour is also overwhelming and strenuous on the eye.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2: An example of bad use of colour and imagery._

Good use of colour ensures a more comfortable experience and will allow users to see what they need to do to reach their goal.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title") _Figure 3: Better use of colour and imagery._

### Does each design element serve a purpose?

User interface design should be meaningful. Each element used in the design should serve a purpose. As soon as elements are added to the interface with no purpose, the design becomes meaningless and confusing.

**Before you add any component to your design, ask these questions:**

**- does my design choice serve a purpose?**

**- will it help the user reach their goal faster and more efficiently or prevent them from reaching their goal and make the overall experience unpleasant?**

Don't use elements to make the overall design appealing. Use elements to make the design purposeful. In the image below, we can see which choices were made to make the overall design purposeful.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4: Good use of design elements that serve a purpose on the app design._

## Structure and consistency

It's essential to have information well organised and structured logically. Elements should be consistent, and the layout should be easy to understand and approach.

There should be an informational and typographical hierarchy. The text must be distinct, and there must be adequate spacing to separate sections and ensure legibility. Buttons and call-to-actions should be highlighted and easy to spot.

Navigation should always be straightforward. Look at the example below. The user’s eye will go to the logo first, and then it will travel across the main navigation to the sign-up CTA, then down to the header and written text and then across to the second CTA.

Also, pay attention to the use of colour on the page. It's consistent from top to bottom, and the buttons are bright and prominent.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5: Good page structure and consistency_

## Flexibility

The design should be adaptable and look good in all situations - on a brand-new iPhone, an old desktop PC and a slick MacBook Pro. This ties in with accessibility and legibility, important factors to consider when you start the design process.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 6: An example of good responsive design._

## Familiarity

Users respond well to patterns they know and feel comfortable using. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when designing a UI. Things like common colour associations (like red for sale, green for available, etc.), navigation menus (like the hamburger menu on mobile) and call-to-actions (button formats, copy used, etc.) are familiar patterns.

The example below shows two different confirmation messages. The one on the left will be more familiar to users than the one on the right because of how the pattern is presented. The confirmation message on the right is confusing, and users could instantly feel uncomfortable.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 7: Two examples of confirmation messages._

## Feedback and user control

A user should always feel in control when using an interface. They should know where they are, how they got there, and what the next step is. It ensures a confident and informed user who will have a good experience.

The example below shows how the user is in control of the checkout process. Every step is indicated by the process bar. The user even has a way to back out and start over. The information icon will provide them with extra information if there is uncertainty. The bright green CTA is prominent and guides them further through the process.

## Lesson Task - Principles of User Interface design

## Lesson Task

### Brief

For this task, you will be using the UI elements and patterns you have gathered and designed in lesson task 1 to create three pages for the Mobile Meals app. You can decide which three pages you want to design, for example, the homepage, the restaurant page, and a login page.

The target audience for this app is aged between 25 and 35. They have busy schedules, so cooking time is limited and ordering food online is more convenient to accommodate their busy lifestyles. Popular restaurants include The PizzaGuy, The BurgerBar and PlatedFresh, a restaurant specialising in healthy food.

## Level 1 Process

- Make a quick sketch of how the layout and placement of elements will potentially look.
- In Adobe XD/Figma create an artboard for any mobile device.
- Focus on what you've learned about UI principles and apply your knowledge to your app's design.
- Ensure the navigation on the app is straightforward and easy to comprehend.

- Ensure the elements are neatly displayed and have a purpose. Make use of a grid structure to help you place elements on the page.
- Design components and elements should align correctly. This will ensure a neat layout throughout.
- The use of colour and typography should be consistent.
- Consider the app's navigation.
- Most importantly, remember to KISS (keep it simple stupid).

## Lesson - Introduction to UX design

## ﻿﻿Lesson Overview

## Lesson - Introduction to UX design

### Introduction

This lesson will explore user experience (UX) design and the tasks and process a UX designer needs to conduct to ensure a good user experience.

## What is UX design?

'User experience design' can mean different processes to different teams. There is no standard definition. Donald Norman, an engineer at Apple, coined the term 'UX design' in the 1990s.

UX design refers to how a product (website/app/platform) has been set up to create a comfortable, functional, smooth and enjoyable experience. The main goal of UX design is to make a website or app user-friendly.

UX permeates all of our interactions in the digital and physical world. Anything we use to complete a task represents a UX. Take the mouse illustrated in the image below, for example. When the mouse runs out of battery life, the user can charge it by connecting the USB to the mouse's bottom.

But herein lies the problem; when the mouse is connected to the USB charger, the user can't use it. Even though the design of the mouse is sleek and stylish, it's unusable while charging. Would you say this is good or bad UX?

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 1: This is a bad UX experience for a user who has to work while the mouse is charging._

To design a successful user experience, you need to be adaptable, a good communicator and someone with high empathy levels. You should be able to place yourself in the user's position and understand what is important to them.

**The UX design process includes various tasks like:**

- user research
- user persona creation

- setting up information architecture
- creating user flows
- conducting user testing.

These concepts are discussed in depth later in this lesson. UX design can also include working with a UI designer to design wireframes and create prototypes.

UX design doesn't include a product's visual design; this would be the user interface designer's role.

UX has been described as making an interface useful or the 'flesh and bones' behind the UI, while UI design makes an interface look good.

## User-friendly

The UX designer has one goal: to ensure the website/app is easy to understand and use, intuitive to navigate and make users feel good.

A product that leaves users frustrated, confused or lost doesn't have good UX. The ideal is to have a website/app that looks good and has a useful UI. If an app only looks nice but doesn't work as you intend it to, there's no point in using it.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2: A UX designer defining user experience._

## Tasks and processes

UX design is built on research. Planning and processes to achieve this include:

### User research

The first part of the process is to figure out who your new website/app/service/platform/system is for. Who is the target audience? What does the user want? User research will make the design process more manageable and possibly also help the product to be successful.

UX research usually starts with quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative research refers to numbers and statistics, and information about quantities. For example, you can let users complete an online survey to answer questions about their eating habits (e.g., how many times a week they eat fast food).

At the end of the research, you’ll have data in numeric form, and you'll most likely be able to spot a pattern at a glance or be able to process it to discover patterns; for instance, 70% of users eat fast food three times a week.

### Examples of quantitative data

- your coffee cups hold 250ml coffee
- between 9 a.m. – 11 a.m. you had 100 users on your site

- 90% of your users access your site through their mobile device.

Qualitative research refers to a user’s behaviour and gathers non-numerical data such as user opinions and reasons for their behaviour. We now know most users eat fast food three times a week, but we need to find out why.

What are the reasons and motivations behind this decision? It could be because of their busy lifestyle or that they crave something delicious. Qualitative research is conducted by observing a user and conducting interviews and surveys with open-ended questions.

### Examples of qualitative data

- Q: Was the checkout process effortless?
- A: No, I found the process frustrating because I couldn’t find the 'add to cart' button.
- Q: Was it easy for you to get in touch with us?
- A: Yes, the contact form made it easy to submit a query, and the confirmation message I received gave me peace of mind.

## User personas and storyboards

Target audience research will assist in the creation of user personas. These personas are fictional, but they represent users' needs, goals and lifestyles to help you better understand your audience and identify where the users’ needs lie.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 3: An example of a user persona._

Storyboards take these user personas and place them in real-life situations to determine how a person could use your product and where they will interact with it.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 4: Storyboard of Audi’s customer engagement (source: slickandquick.com)._

## Information architecture

Information architecture (IA) is structuring a website to ensure the content is presented in an orderly fashion and information is structured intuitively for the end-user.

Information should be laid out logically so that content across the website or app is easy to find and navigate. Imagine reading a book without chapters organised in the right sequence or browsing a website with no landing page; the user will be confused.

Humans crave structure and will interact much better with a system that is intuitive and sensible.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 5: Information on the architecture of a simple website._

### User flows

Mapping the basic user journey and route a user will follow - from beginning to end - when using your product is the user flow and helps you optimise and plan the user's process and experience.

### Wireframes and prototypes

Wireframes and prototypes are things that UI designers usually work on with UX designers and are the beginning stages of the visual design process. This topic will be covered more thoroughly later on in the programme.

## Lesson Task - Introduction to UX design

### Lesson Task

Search for three products you interact with daily. These can include the coffee machine you use every morning, the weather app you use to see if rain is predicted, and the remote control of your TV, etc.

Think of how you interact with these products. Which elements do you consider bad UX, and which do you consider good UX? Make a list of each product's positives and negatives, and think about how you can improve each product's overall user experience.

## Lesson - Principles of UX design

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

### Introduction

This lesson will look at the fundamental principles of UX design and how designers use them for a good user experience.

### UX design principles

UX design is all about how users feel while interacting with your product. It is the process used to create experiences that are meaningful and relevant to the user. In this process, we centralise the role of the user and focus all design decisions around them.

Here are a few fundamental points to help you succeed when creating a user-centered experience:

### Focus on user needs

It is important to understand who your users (customers/clients) are and what they need the product to do for them. We establish the users' needs through user testing and research. Remember that you are not necessarily the user, and what you might find to be the best solution for yourself might not be the best solution for the user.

We need to centralise the user as the focal point for all our design decisions. Imagine having a new baby or pet in the house. Every decision and every move you make will be with them in mind, and the entire house will be rearranged to ensure the new member is comfortable and happy.

This is essentially what you need to focus on when it comes to the UX design of a website or app. Every decision should be based on the users' need and how they will interact with the interface. Giving the user what they need will ensure a happy user who will most probably return to your website.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 1: An example of user and business needs._

### Information hierarchy

How a site’s content is organised dramatically impacts how the user interacts with a product. This includes the navigation (menus) and how the headings and content are grouped and laid out. The more logical and well-considered the content, the more user-friendly the product will be.

Information should be presented to the user according to importance. The most important piece of information comes first. Keep in mind that users scan through information and need to do so quickly and effortlessly.

The image below demonstrates a bad information hierarchy. The hamburger menu on the desktop is not intuitive and doesn’t tell the user what they can do on the website.

The article itself is hard to read. The header, subheader and body text are the same text size and not enticing enough for a user to want to know more about the news story. The 'sign up' should also be more prominent. The way it looks now, a user will scroll past it and not even notice it.

![Alt text](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Figure 2: Bad information hierarchy._

The image below is the same website, but the designers paid more attention to the information hierarchy. The main header is big enough to attract attention to the title of the story, the subheader gives more information into what happened, and the body text explains in full detail what went down. Pay attention to how spacing and grouping are used on the page:

- The main header is first, and below it is more information on the journalist and the article's time and date. The main header and information are grouped together.
- Then there is an open space.

- We can see the main image underneath the open space with details about the image and the photographer's name. The image and details below are also grouped together.
- More open space.
- The subheader is a bit smaller than the main header but still bigger than the body text.
- More open space.
- Then the user is presented with the rest of the news story.

- More open space.
- Then the sign up. The CTA button is prominent for users to see the action immediately.

The way information is presented in the design below will entice the user to read the article. Not only that, but the user will be able to scan through the story quickly, get the details and move on to the next headline.

### Consistency

Consistency helps users become familiar with your product quickly, making it easier for them to learn and use. If there is too much inconsistency with your product’s usability, users will get confused and demotivated. They might become discouraged to come back to your product.

Elements on a page need to look consistent and function similarly from one page to another. When you look at the example below, you can see CTAs are the same from one page to another. The icons are consistent in their placement, and the use of colour is also the same throughout.

### Accessibility

The website or app should be accessible for all users. Designing with this in mind is vital. The design should be responsive on all screen sizes and cater to users with disabilities.

Ensuring there is a good contrast between background and text colour is one way to ensure accessibility. The text should not be too small and should be easy to read when a user accesses the website in a room with minimum light, for example.

The example below demonstrates bad colour contrast, which will make the message hard to read for users without disabilities, let alone those whose vision is impaired.

## User feedback

The user should know where they are in the process of using your product: Where are they, how did they get there, and what should they do next? Confirming their actions with an animation, design change, or text prompt is an essential feature that keeps them engaged and informed.

The UX designer also needs to consider the context in which feedback is given to a user. This includes the physical context and emotional context. Like with any feedback in life, we need to know what needs to change where, and because feedback can sometimes come across as reprimanding, UX designers need to pay close attention to how it is conveyed.

Usually, when a user is given bad news, designers will do it with more empathy than congratulating them on purchasing a product or winning a weekend away for two. The physical context feedback should happen where it is visible on the page and where the user can clearly see it.

Think of when adding an item to your online cart. You’ll receive immediate feedback saying your item was successfully added, and you can then proceed to checkout.

### Simplicity

The Nielsen Norman Group summed up the definition of user experience design perfectly by saying that the first requirement for an excellent user experience is to meet the customer's exact needs without fuss or bother. The next step is simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a pleasure to use (Nielsen Norman Group, 2016).

Clarity and simplicity ensure a good user experience. It leads the user on a smooth and uncluttered journey that avoids confusion. Overwhelming the user with too many options and/or complex solutions could make them give up the process. Keep all aspects of your product as simple, linear and straightforward as possible.
