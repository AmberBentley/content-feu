Lesson - What is Interaction Design? 

 

Introduction 

This lesson contains 3 activities that you should complete as you go through it. 
 
In this first lesson we're going to be looking at what interaction design is, and what sort of problems it is trying to solve. Interaction Design, sometimes shortened to IxD, is a relatively new field that requires us to use our imagination and empathy to understand the user, their goals, and how to best design a system for them. 

What is Interaction Design? 

Have you ever had an experience where you tried to use an everyday product with an unusual design? Perhaps you were on holiday and tried to use a stove you’ve never used before and couldn’t figure out which knob turned on which plate, or you were borrowing a car and couldn’t figure out how to get a feature to work. 
 
Don Norman, in his book 'The Design of Everyday Things', discusses his frustrations with doors that are built for aesthetics rather than practicality. He describes a situation where people encountered clear glass doors. Where do you push? Or is it pull? Or is it automatic? Does it slide sidewards or do I need to step back because it'll open into me? 
 
These are the sorts of situations that the broader scope of interaction design is trying to solve. Interaction design (IxD) is focussed on the moment of interaction between a human and a product (usually technology). The goal of interaction design is to make this process as smooth and beneficial as possible. Unlike other design principles, interaction design explores the design of behaviour and puts the human user first. 
 
Understanding how and why the user is using each product is important. For example you want the interaction with a light switch to be as quick and simple as possible, but the opposite might be true for a mobile app where the user might want to spend time engaging with content. 
 
In web design, different websites will attract different users with different goals. Each website needs to ensure it is made with the best design for its unique case. 

Multi-disciplinary field 

Interaction design is a very broad field that forces us to look outside of our specific context and understand the many elements at work and the goals that everyone in the system has. 

An interaction designer must take into account the three following areas: 

Business goals: An interaction designer must understand what the business is trying to achieve with its website or app and how the marketing team is looking to achieve those goals. 

Technology limitations: They must also understand the constraints of technology and how to overcome those hurdles. 

User goals: Finally and most importantly, interaction designers need to be able to know and understand what the user wants and how best to design the system to suit them. 

On most web projects there are two sides to the work. The one is the marketing department/management who have done research into what they want to sell, but often their requirements for the site and design tend to be vague and open-ended. The worst example of this is "make the design pop". What does that even mean? This vague instruction must now be interpreted by the designer and developer and made into an actual working design. 
 
Developers on the other hand deal mostly with specifics and are deadline driven and so tend to place an emphasis on getting the work out the door. 
 
This disconnect often leaves a gap with the question of, "what does the user want?" usually left unanswered. 

User Experience 

You might wonder, what the difference between User Experience and Interaction Design is. Well, User Experience (UX) is a wider view of the experience the user has with the product. Interaction Design is focussed on the moment the user is actually interacting with the product. 
 
UX design includes interaction design alongside the visuals and content.

User First 

Picture the following: you’re in a meeting and your manager comes in and says, "we've got a new project to work. You need to create a website for the local tourism information office." 
 
What are your first thoughts? What colours and fonts are going to be used? What languages and code frameworks will be best? How many web pages do they need? 
 
While these are useful thoughts, the aim with interaction design is to put the user front and centre of the design process. We are designing and building the site for them and our first question should be aimed at understanding the user. 

Common Mistakes 

There are a number of mistakes that people make when designing a site, sometimes because they misguidedly believe it will benefit the user or they have never bothered to consider the user. 
 
Too much information. A common problem is simply providing the user with overwhelming options and information. It is vital when designing a website, that it is clear in what it wants to communicate. A part of this issue can also be the use of jargon or industry specific language. Make sure you are pitching the information at their level, and even if some of your users are experts it doesn't mean all of them are. 
 
Too much explanation. Obviously there is occasionally a need for shepherding technology that will help guide the user, but first prize should be that the interaction is so seamless that users instinctively know what to do. Just like with a new TV, while the instructions might come in the box, very few people will ever actually read them. We must design the system to function intuitively. 
 
Bad anticipation of user's needs. This can go both ways by under-anticipating the user's needs perhaps by not giving them a purchase button when they want it. Or by over-anticipating and double guessing them with questions like "did you mean to click that?" 
 
Creators never simplified their ideas. The brainstorming phase of any design can be great, but if you never spent time simplifying your ideas you might end up with too many ideas vying for space. How many super users will you have? Chances are that unless the business has high customer retention, many of the users will be intermediate or new. 
 
Choosing aesthetics first. While visual design is important, it must always serve the end goal of improving the user's experience rather than simply creating pretty design. 
 
Blaming the user for mistakes. Many websites tend to push back error messages to the user about what they did or didn't do. If the user is getting errors, it's the fault of the design. Often the product is designed to only be used in one way. This makes the user have to change to fit the product. 

Goal Directed Design 

While we might think that the aim of a website should be to achieve a business goal, it is much better to rather think of meeting user goals. We need to understand what the user wants and expects so that we can meet their needs and desires. 

Root Cause Analysis 

An online clothing store might think that the goal of the website is to sell an item of clothing, but for the user the goal might be to find a good fitting shirt. 
 
But this goal is actually not even the primary driver for the user. They need a good fitting shirt because they're going on a date that evening. This is their actual motivation – to look good for their date. The website needs to help them achieve this goal rather than just sell them a shirt. 
 
Using root cause analysis we can find out the real reason users are on the site. We can do this for a number of different scenarios. When someone orders a taxi, is their goal to go from A to B, or could their goal be to have a fun evening with friends? 
 
This goal analysis can be broken down at various stages in the process. At the beginning their goal might be to have an evening out, but then their next goal is to find a reliable taxi company, and their next goal is to find the cheapest fare. The website needs to help the user achieve different goals at different points in the process. 
 
When designing the interaction, it's important to not just see a list of tasks, but a series of goals that must be achieved. We should focus on asking "why?" and not "what?". 
 
While the technology might change with time, the goals themselves are more resilient and less likely to change. It is therefore important that we design with the future in mind. 

Make Sure Models Match 

There are three main ways of modelling a product: the developer's view, the user's view, and the designer's view. 
 
The developer's view will usually be a technical one about how the product is built etc. The user isn't focussed on how a product is made, but what it does and how it works. The designer's job is to make the product as close to this image as possible for the user.

Video: Living With Complexity 

 

For this lesson assignment you need to find an everyday object that you think could be improved upon, and then re-design the object to create a better interaction. The object can be in your home or at work or anywhere really. 

Ask yourself the following questions: 

As the user, what are my goals? What are the primary goals and what are secondary? 

What constraints does this product have? 

What limitations does the current design have? 

Are there opportunities for a more logical and intuitive design? 

When you've asked these questions, try re-designing the product on paper or on your computer.

Lesson - Design Research 

 

Introduction 

This lesson contains 4 activities that you should complete as you go through it. 

Design Research 

In years gone by there was a disconnect between the marketing department who often did the research, and the designers and developers who make and design the product. This is why it is important that the whole team be involved at the research level so that everyone has an equal understanding of the user. 

Quantitative vs Qualitative 

Market research tends to be focussed more on quantitative rather than qualitative data. Quantitative data is concerned with quantity (how many) whereas qualitative data is concerned with quality and in-depth knowledge. 
 
We gather quantitative data by analysing web analytics, market segmentation and broad user analysis. This is great at telling us what people want to buy, but it doesn't help us understand why they want to buy it and how they want to interact. 
 
It can be useful to start with quantitative research to analyse what segment our user is likely to be from, then perform qualitative research to understand more about them in depth. Then later, once we have our models in place, quantitative data can help us understand how a particular persona fits into our wider user group. 
 
The difficulty of quantitative data is that it focusses on data points like clicks, time on site, surveys, etc. But unfortunately the user can't be reduced to a click. They're much more complex with moods and desires, and therefore require analyses that capture these complexities. 

Learn About the Product 

Before you can start your research you need to understand what the product is and how it works. You can get this insight by having meetings with the various stakeholders, and by researching the field yourself. Sometimes you'll be working in a field in which you are unfamiliar and you'll need to spend some time reading and researching to understand the context in which the business operates. 
 
Remember, even though we are focussed on the user's goals, it is critical to analyse the business goals to make sure we're building a sustainable product for the client. 
 
Meetings with the stakeholders offer insight into their business goals, but also into any constraints and limitations that exist. Most of the stakeholders are knowledgeable about their own product, so use this to your advantage. 
 
You can also interview Subject Matter Experts who have specific insights and understandings in a particular field. They might be 'super-users' and so it's important to understand that your users might differ from them. 

Collect Qualitative Data 

When you are collecting user data it's important to get representative users doing representative tasks. There's no use collecting data from people who aren't like your end users, and who are not completing tasks related to your product. 
 
It's best to conduct interviews and assessments in a location where the user is likely to use your product. This gives you insight that you might otherwise never have gotten, plus it helps the user to relax and feel at ease. Ideally they shouldn't feel analysed in a scientific way, but rather see your meeting with them as a collaboration. 
 
Observing users is often better than interviews because people aren't easily able to self-assess and communicate issues they encounter. Sometimes a user will have found a workaround solution to a problem that they wouldn't think to share in an interview, but you'll spot these when observing. Do they have passwords on sticky notes next to their computer? Do they always need to Google something before they can complete a task? 
 
Try to observe them rather than leading them through any processes. Ask open-ended questions that can get them talking and explaining what they're doing. You should take on the role of the apprentice and have them explaining what they want and any issues they have. Listen for any goals they might have as this will give you insights later to determine what the user really wants. 
 
When interviewing and observing users, we need to have open minds to see and explore various elements of the design and their interaction with it. It's very unlikely that you will get a homogenous group of users. This means that you are also unlikely to get easy answers for major design decisions early on in the process. Over a series of iterations you will probably start to see certain patterns emerge. 
 
It's important to note that there is a difference between users and customers. They are usually the same people, but in large corporate enterprises or scientific and medical organisations, the users might be very different to the customers. For example, at a school, the teachers might be the users, while the principal might be the customer who will actually pay for the product. 

Contextual Inquiry 

The following is a technique that will help you in conducting interviews and observations with users. It was developed by Beyer and Holtzblatt and is called Contextual Inquiry and places an emphasis on conducting observations within a specific context and environment. Try going to their workplace or home to see how they would normally interact. 
 
It is important that you create a partnership with the person you are observing and that they feel like they are leading the exploration to solve problems and overcome issues. 
 
When interpreting the sessions, you need to read between the lines to understand and un-pack why users say and do certain things. Remember, users aren't as objective as they might seem. 

Conclude Research 

When you have finished observing users you need to extract that data and make it useful and understandable. You need to start grouping certain goals, issues and other attributes that the various users had. 
 
It's best to do this as close to when you have collected the research in order to ensure accuracy. This phase of grouping users based on similar attributes leads us on to personas, which we'll be covering in the next lesson.

Lesson Task - Design Research 

Lesson Task 

Brief 

You will continue to work on your cross-course project. This is the one you designed and built in the first semester. 
 
In this task, we’re going to conduct some design research for your chosen site by looking at two or three competitor websites and asking users to interact with them. 
 
In normal projects, you’d perform a lot more interviews, but for this task we will just be doing one so that you can get a feel for how it would go. 

Level 1 Process 

Choose two or three websites for the user to work with. 

Choose specific tasks that you want the user to do. Eg. Find a red jacket that costs less than $... 

Next, sit down with the potential user at a computer (if you can’t physically sit down with them, then a video conference call will work). 

Ask the users to perform the specific tasks you decided on, and encourage them to give feedback as they work. Try not to lead them, but let them explain why they’re doing certain things, and what they like/don’t like about each site. 

After the interview, consider what surprised you about how the user interacted with the websites, and what they did as expected. Were there any sticking points which could be made easier for the user? What did they like and what didn’t they like on the different sites? 

Level 2 Process 

Ask the user to interact with your website. Give them the same tasks you asked them to perform with the competitor websites. How did your site fare in comparison? Can you see where you might make adjustments? 

Consider performing further contextual inquiry interviews with other users to see what they think. The more users you interview, the more rounded a perspective you can get. 

Lesson - Personas and Scenarios 

﻿﻿Lesson Overview 

Lesson - Personas and Scenarios 

 

Introduction 

This lesson contains 5 activities that you should complete as you go through it. 

Personas 

Once you have completed your research into the users, it's time to start making inferences based on that research. Personas are a great tool for being able to communicate the various goals, motivations, and pain points for various users. 
 
A persona is a realistic abstraction of a group of users. For any project there is likely to be a variety of personas, but what personas force us to do is to reduce the complexity of the research into manageable, understandable, and useful chunks. 
 
Personas are imagined users, but they should be as fully fledged as possible. The common attributes you discovered in your research should be joined to form attributes for your various personas, including their name, their job title, their interests, their skill level with technology, and even their worries and concerns for the future. By making inferences from the research we're able to find common elements that a grouping of users have in common. 
 
The trick with personas is not to be too broad. It's easy to want to include all the different points you captured, but it just won't be useful down the line. Make sure you don't add every edge-case into your design or add any 'just-in-case' features. You'll end up frustrating your users with too much clutter. Design for your main personas and the other users will thank you for it. 
 
For example, when looking for a shirt, nobody is looking for a shirt that is both smart and casual and sporty and comfy and good-looking. Each person buys a shirt that reflects their personality, but also that reflects specific contexts. Certain personas in certain contexts like certain shirts. It's the same with any other product and interaction. 
 
A major advantage of using personas is their ability to create a consensus across the team. When developing your personas, make sure to include the different people who will be working on the project. This helps get a buy-in from the whole group and ensures there's a commonality of focus. It also helps if there's a shared vocabulary as you start to 'get to know' your various personas, for example "oh Angela wouldn't use it in that way" or "Bob would really like this". 
 
The other major advantage to using personas is that it gives you something concrete to talk about. When you simply talk about 'the user' it can mean many things to many people and become distorted based on who is talking. 
 
Personas differ from market segmentation which is focussed on dividing users based on the purchasing decisions. It is useful to take marketing research into consideration, but understand their bias towards sales. They aren't focussed on what the user really wants, but rather on what the user will buy and how to get them to buy. 
 
You might find that some personas will be more important to you and can become your primary persona, while other personas form a secondary group. You might even have negative personas, these are users you don't want to build your product for.

Goals and Processing Levels 

When we are creating models to understand our users, we must analyse and understand their unique goals. Goals are the center of the interaction design process, and so should be clearly defined. Even though our personas are an amalgamation of various users, they should still feel very real and have desires and goals. They must engage our empathy and have the team be able to identify and relate to each persona. 
 
According to Don Norman in 'Emotional Design' there are three levels of processing for goals: visceral, behavioural and reflective. This processing occurs either in the conscious or sub-conscious brain, and helps us to uncover different ways of processing information and determining goals. 

Visceral Level 

At the visceral level are the user's quick and immediate responses. Here the user engages the more primal side of their brain as they make snap decisions about the product and tasks. When designing for this level we need to understand that the design will affect different people in different ways. One example of this is how people tend to find good looking products easier to use, even if it isn't necessarily easier. This level focusses especially on instinct and the subconscious mind to make decisions. 
 
The visceral level of processing ties well to 'experience goals'. This refers to how the user wants to feel when they use the product. If users have a bad experience this will affect other levels of processing and can lead to them later avoiding the product. 

Behavioural Level 

At the behavioural level, the user's conscious mind is able to create the desire to complete a task, but the subconscious brain helps it to complete the task. I can think “I want to check a spreadsheet”, but I don't think about the step-by-step process for doing so. I instinctively reach for my mouse, find the file, and open it almost entirely without consciously going through each step. 
 
This level pairs with the goals that the user has for this specific interaction. How can they complete the task, and can that be made easier for them to figure that out? It's useful to think about call-to-actions for this level. Create clear buttons and navigation to aid behavioural processing. The user mustn't think about what they're doing, they should simply be doing. 

Reflective Level 

The next level is reflective. This is when the user will look back over their actions and decide whether they are satisfied or not, and who should be blamed or praised depending on the outcome. 
 
This occurs after the interaction has happened and engages the user's long-term goals. What do they want from life? Do they feel happy, proud, safe? A failure at this level can lead to buyer's remorse and can possibly stop the user from ever wanting to engage with the product, even if there are new changes and updates made. 

Scenarios 

Once we have our personas, we can now see them in action. After all, interaction design is about behavior and what better way to see the behaviour in the system than by getting your personas to take action. 
 
Storytelling is a very important creative tool that allows us to find and unlock interesting parts of the process. When we imagine scenarios we can easily sort through the various options available to us and develop empathy for our personas at the various points in the process. 
 
An important reason to use scenarios is that it is a great communication tool and helps all the different team members understand where and how the product will be used. 
 
Using scenarios gives us an overview of the wider process and helps us avoid making errors in the system and spot if anything is missing. If there are gaps in the process, it's better to find them now rather than further down the line. 
 
There are multiple paths your users can choose from. It's important to analyse the possible interactions from a variety of user's perspectives as the different personas might all use your product differently to achieve different goals. 

Storyboards 

Mainly used by film-makers to prepare for scenes they want to shoot, storyboards offer us a way of visualizing the scenarios we have come up with and see them in drawings. 
 
There is no place for unnecessary details in our storyboards and so this forces us to focus on the most critical components of the story. We want to map only the important actions and functions. The focus here is not on the interface design but on how a persona achieves their goal using the product.

Design Requirements 

Once we have an understanding of the process that our user will go on when using our product we are at a place where we can start analysing the requirements for the design. These requirements should include the goals and pain points along the process and how those are to be met. 
 
We must define the user and business needs for the product and begin to imagine how those needs will be satisfied by the product.

﻿﻿Lesson Overview 

Lesson - Usability Testing 

 

Introduction 

This lesson introduces usability testing. 

Usability Testing? 

Why Do We Conduct Usability Testing? 

Developers, designers, and other product stakeholders might get locked in certain types of thinking while working on a certain project. They might be unable to see issues on the interface or with the flow of the website. A developer’s view might also be more technical than your average user - performing technical tasks which might seem easy for a developer could be quite difficult for real users. There might be several issues we haven’t thought of which usability testing can reveal. Assessing real users and their interactions with your product is vital to the success of your product. 

What Is Usability Testing?  

Usability testing allows us to test how user-friendly a site is and whether users get lost or confused at any point. Good interaction design should help users achieve their goals. If there are aspects of the site which make it harder to achieve their goals, they must be fixed. 
 
Usability testing can be performed at various stages of the process, from the paper prototype at the start of the project, through to the website before launching. It can even take the form of continued testing down the line. At almost every point in a product life cycle, it is useful to understand how a user will interact with the product. 

What are the advantages of Usability Testing? 

One of the main advantages of usability testing over something like a survey is that while a survey might give you quantitative data about what a user says they would do, the reality of what they actually do might be very different.  Usability testing lets you see a user in action to know what they really do. Sometimes users might tell an interviewer a white lie to make themselves seem more capable, but actually observing what users do often provides more quality data to improve your website. 

Methods for Testing Users 

There are two main decisions to make when determining how to test your users: 

Should the sessions be in-person or remote? 
In-person testing allows you to get more details from the user. You can see their body language, ask them questions, and see things such as how they hold their mobile phone when working with your mobile site. This gives a deep level of information, but it is more time consuming and expensive. 

Should we ask specific questions or leave the session open-ended? 
This decision depends slightly on the stage of the process and also what information you are aiming to gather. If you’re doing a broad test of whether the website has good user experience, you might consider leaving things open-ended to allow the user to explore the site. However, if you have specific areas of the site you want to test, then guiding the user with questions such as “can you ‘favourite’ an item on the site?” might be a better choice. 

Tools 

Hotjar 

Hotjar is a popular behaviour analytics tool which allows stakeholders to collect data on real users interacting on their website. This is an ideal tool for remote, open-ended sessions where we simply see user interactions on a site without guiding them to take specific actions. 

Heatmaps 
Heatmaps allow you to see how popular certain areas of your site are, and it tracks clicks, taps and scrolling. This gives insight into which links are popular, or how far down a page a user scrolls. 

Visitor Recordings 
The other main functionality on Hotjar is the screen recordings where you can see actual users and their interactions as they move around the page. This gives you a very detailed view of how the user has interacted on the site, where their cursor goes, what they try to click etc. It is worthwhile noting that Hotjar are GDPR compliant. 

Video on Hotjar 
Watch the following video on Hotjar: 

Accessibility Testing 

When considering the usability of our websites, we also need to think about how usable they are for all people, regardless of the user’s abilities. 
 
To test that our site is easy to use for a visually impaired user, we could install a screen reader to see how a user would interact on our page. Download NVDA for Windows and Voiceover for Mac. Then use your keyboard to navigate around the page. You can use the TAB key to move between links, and ENTER to move to that page. 

Browser Extensions 

Adding an extension to your browser is a effective way of testing the accessibility of your website. 

For Chrome 

For Firefox 

These extensions will flag potential issues such as images missing alt text, or unclear links, or contrast issues for users. 

Google Analytics 

Primarily a marketing tool, Google Analytics can be useful for interaction designers and developers. 
 
Google Analytics tracks: 

how many users visit the site. 

how many pages they visit. 

how long they stay on the site. 

whether they complete their purchase or not. 

and many other insights. 

Using Google Analytics exposes potential issues. It is a higher-level view than something like Hotjar, but it is still a useful part of analyzing the effectiveness of a website. 

Lesson Task - Usability Testing 

Lesson Task

Add Hotjar to the website for your cross-course project. Send it to friends and family and ask them to use the website to help you collect data. The data we collect using Hotjar will be used in the Course Assignment for Interaction Design, so it’s important that you install it early to collect the data you need.
