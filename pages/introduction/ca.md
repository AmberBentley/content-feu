## Brief

At the end of every course is a course assignment. This Course Assignment won't count for marks, but is useful to practice the process of delivering as wll as giving you an opportunity to meet and engage with your fellow students.

For the course assignment you're going to need to introduce yourself to your classmates on Discord, and write a reflective post on your thoughts as you start your studies

## Level 1 Process

1. A link to Discord was sent in your welcoming email from a student success manager. Go to your class channel on Discord (i.e. 2022-august-full-time, 2022-october-part-time). Write a presentation of yourself including things like your background and interests.

2. In the interest of getting to know other students, it is important that we take advantage of the user profile on Moodle. Provide a picture or an avatar, and write about yourself and your interests, so that tutors and fellow students get to know you. This could for instance be a shorter version of what you posted on Discord earlier, but with added keywords. Writing your home town can be helpful for teachers if there's a job/internship for a specific city/town.

3. Write a reflective post discussing why you chose this study and what you're hoping to get out of it. What has your experience of the introduction been? You can use Microsoft Word or Google Docs or any other word processor.

4. Style your reflective post. You can choose fonts, colors, backgrounds, whatever you'd like to use to add your personality to the design of the post.

5. Save the post as a PDF, and share the post on the 'Peer Feedback' forum on Moodle. Giving peer feedback is a very important skill to build, and getting peer feedback is a great opportunity to improve your own work. Here's a video with suggestions for giving peer feedback https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1ww_1AJzI A good format for giving peer feedback is to first state the positives in the person's work, before making some suggestions for improvement, before concluding with a positive about their work. Remember to give the sort of feedback that you would like to receive. You will need to submit your post for feedback and give feedback to at least two students before you can access the delivery on Moodle.

6. Make any adjustments based on the feedback you've received and submit to Moodle.
